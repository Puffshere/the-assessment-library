                        The United States Department of 
                        Commerce and the European Commission 
                        have agreed on a set of data protection 
                        principles and frequently asked 
                        questions to enable U.S. companies to 
                        satisfy the requirement under European 
                        Union law that adequate protection be 
                        given to personal information 
                        transferred from the EEA to the United

                        protection (OJ L 45, 15.2.2001, p.47).

                        of principles and frequently asked 
                        questions to enable U.S. companies to 
                        satisfy the requirement under Swiss law 
                        that adequate protection be given to 
                        personal information transferred from 
                        Switzerland to the United States (the

                        privacy, A24X7 adheres to the principles 
                        set forth in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and

                    <p>
                        A24X7 sees the Internet and the use of 
                        other technology as valuable tools to

                        others. A24X7 recognizes the importance 
                        of maintaining the privacy of 
                        information collected online and has
