                    <p>
                        There are really only two ways to sell anything. One is a struggle most of the time. Let's call this one "Hard Selling". The other 
                        seems pretty effortless. The other is called "Collaborative Selling," which guarantees you huge rewards, an endless flow of 
                        ready-to-buy prospects, and creates an environment for you to have incredible fun doing it.
