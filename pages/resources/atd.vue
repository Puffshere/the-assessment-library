                    <p>
                        There are really only two ways to sell anything. One is a struggle most of the time. Let's call this one "Hard Selling". The other 
                        seems pretty effortless. The other is called "Collaborative Selling," which guarantees you huge rewards, an endless flow of 
                        ready-to-buy prospects, and creates an environment for you to have incredible fun doing it.

                        In this entertaining and thought-provoking book, the authors argue that the "Golden Rule" is not always the best way to approach

                        makes people tick and adapt from there.

                        information and tools. From business meetings, to sales calls, to getting your kids to do their homework, to getting help from a 
                        store clerk…charisma gives you an edge in life that few people have. <br/><span class="badge">Duration: <strong>21:44</strong></span>
