                    <p>
                        This course guides workshop participants on a path of heightened self-awareness and personal discovery. DISC Workshop 
                        Leaders can make this their cornerstone seminar, revealing each participant’s unique behavioral style blend and 
                        “how to” apply that knowledge prescriptively, boosting communication effectiveness. Studies indicate that 92% of workplace 
                        conflict is the result of misunderstanding and communication breakdowns. Entire organizations can apply DISC’s 
                        prescriptive lessons of behavioral adaptability to reduce employee conflict and turnover, increase productivity, and 
                        optimize team performance.

                    <p>
                        Transitioning from Peer to Leader is a course tailor-made for participants in transition from individual contributors to 
                        leaders - whether it be supervisor, manager or executive. DISC Workshop Leaders will guide new leaders through an engaging 
                        course, centered around understanding successful leaders’ many-faceted roles and responsibilities. Participants will be 
                        prepared for how to navigate employee stressors through DISC communication skills, and how to effectively share and manage 
                        performance expectations. Participants will focus on developing action plans to apply what they’ve learned. Transitioning 
                        from Peer to Leader may begin with a promotion, but it requires far more than just adapting to a new job.

                    <p>
                        Our strongest relationships are rooted in trust. An organization’s most critical relationships exist between its leaders 
                        and individual contributors. DISC Workshop Leaders can help organizations create an environment of leadership influence 
                        rooted in trust – through effective communication, credibility, and confidence. Participants will explore the impact their 
                        leadership style has on others, through activities and practical examples. Best practices include the importance of 
                        excellent listening, creating an environment of accountability, and identifying individual versus team needs. By 
                        remaining conscious of the leadership roles and responsibilities that trusting relationships, organizations can 
                        create a working environment focused on growth and retention.

                        Teamwork is defined by Merriam-Webster as, “the combined action of a group of people, especially when effective and 
                        efficient.” With this DISC Workshop, you can instill organizations with the skills, strategies, and tools to create 
                        teams that excel. During this skill-building course, workshop participants will learn how to assemble teams based on 
                        complementary behaviors to enhance communication, cooperation, and outcomes. Additionally, participants will learn 
                        to distinguish among varying  attitudes and behaviors, using the insightful DISC Team Dynamics report.

                    <p>
                        One of DISC’s most intriguing applications is leveraging behavioral identification and adaptability for sales. 
                        Being able to efficiently identify the behavioral styles of others empowers professionals with the insights to 
                        adapt their selling style, to meet the buying style of their prospect. As seasoned sales professionals will tell 
                        you, winning a new client is really just the beginning of the professional selling process. Building and maintaining 
                        your relationships is critical for sustained, reciprocal sales success. Participants will also learn how to strengthen 
                        these relationships, in order to transform buyers into brand advocates. Other topics covered in this course include: 
                        identifying client needs, managing client expectations, and a complete exploration of the sales process from A to Z.
