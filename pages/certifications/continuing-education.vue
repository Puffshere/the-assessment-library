                        Unlike many other behavioral assessments, our online DISC assessments are accurate psychological tests built from the renowned research of 
                        respected psychologist William Moulton Marston, which aim to classify subjects' behavior. Online DISC assessments can help you better 
                        understand what drives your personal interactions in the workplace, in social situations and within your family.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Your DISC online assessment consists of 30 questions designed to gauge your strongest, as well as your least influential, tendencies. When 
                        you begin, you will choose a focus for your assessment--work, social or family. Then, you will learn where you lie on the DISC spectrum. 
                        Marston believed there are four behavioral types: dominant, interactive, steady and compliant.
