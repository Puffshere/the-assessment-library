                    <p>
                        This course helps workshop participants gain a deeper understanding of themselves and how they
                        interact with others. It reveals each participant's unique behavioral style and provides practical
                        guidance on how to use this knowledge to improve communication and relationships.
                        Most interpersonal conflict is caused by misunderstanding and communication breakdowns. By
                        understanding their own behavioral style and the styles of others, anyone can learn to communicate
                        more effectively and build stronger relationships. This can lead to reduced conflict, increased
                        productivity, and improved performance in both professional and personal relationships.

                    <p>
                        Transitioning from Peer to Leader prepares new leaders for the many challenges of their new role.
                        Participants will learn how to effectively communicate with employees, manage performance
                        expectations, and develop action plans. The course is centered around understanding the different
                        roles and responsibilities of successful contributors as they make the transition to leadership.
                        Participants will learn how to use DISC communication skills to navigate employee stressors and
                        build strong relationships. They will also learn how to set clear expectations and provide feedback
                        in a way that motivates employees. Moving from peer to leader can be a significant change, but this
                        course can help new leaders make a smoother transition by gaining the critical skills and knowledge
                        they need to take on their new role.

                    <p>
                        Trust is the foundation of all strong relationships. The most critical relationships in an
                        organization are those between leaders and individual contributors. DISC Workshop Leader Essentials:
                        Trust-based Leadership can help organizations create an environment of leadership influence rooted
                        in trust by teaching effective communication, credibility, and confidence. Participants will grow to
                        understand the impact of their leadership style on others, communicate effectively with different
                        behavioral styles, build credibility and earn trust, create an environment of accountability and
                        responsibility, and identify individual and team needs. By focusing on the leadership roles and
                        responsibilities that create trusting relationships, organizations can ensure a productive work
                        environment focused on growth and retention.

                    <p>
                        Teamwork is the combined action of a group of people, especially when it is effective and efficient.
                        This DISC workshop can help organizations develop the skills, strategies, and tools they need to
                        create teams that excel. During this team-focused skill-building course, participants will learn to
                        assemble and interact with teams based on complementary behaviors as well as embracing and
                        understanding diversity and its benefits. This will help to improve communication, cooperation, and
                        results-based outcomes. Participants will also learn to distinguish varying beliefs and behaviors
                        using the insightful DISC Team Dynamics report.

                    <p>
                        DISC is a powerful tool that can be used to improve sales performance by understanding the
                        behavioral styles of others and adapting your selling strategy to identify and meet the needs of
                        your prospects. This can lead to more closed deals and stronger, longer relationships with clients.
                        In addition to identifying behavioral, communication, and buying styles, this course will also teach
                        participants to build and maintain relationships with clients, transform buyers into brand
                        advocates, identify client needs, manage expectations, and complete a thorough exploration of a
                        sales process from A to Z. This course is ideal for sales professionals of all levels who want to
                        improve their sales skills and build customer retention.
