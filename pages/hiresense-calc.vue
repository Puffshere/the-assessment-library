                <p>Employers spend an enormous amount on hiring—an average of $4,129 per job in the United States,
                    according to
                    Society for Human Resource Management estimates, and many times that amount for managerial roles—and
                    the
                    United
                    States fills a staggering 66 million jobs a year. Most of the $20 billion that companies spend on
                    human
                    resources vendors goes to hiring.

                <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 400;">What is HireSense?</h2>
                <p>A subscription based hiring process saving time and money, while elevating the quality of hire
                    Instead of per-test fees, a subscription gives unlimited use of the features of HireSense. <br />
                    This is better because of: <br />
                <ul style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
                    <li>
                        Predictable costs: total cost is known before you get started.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lower total costs: The effectiveness of HireSense delivering accurate data reduces time to make
                        a
                        decision
                        and reduces the cost of multiple interviews.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduced time spent on hiring process: Instead of a screening interview for all applicants the
                        final
                        decision
                        making interview it reserved for the best fit applicants, the ones at the top of the "hiring
                        funnel."
                    </li>
                </ul>
