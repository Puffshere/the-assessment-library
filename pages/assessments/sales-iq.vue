                        Most people know that the measure of a salesperson’s success is their ability to make sales. However, how can a sales manager or organization determine a sales 
                        professional’s current skill level and how can sales professionals effectively identify their own areas of improvement, while finding practical solutions for 
                        correcting them?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As with any profession, there are a multitude of skills, behaviors, knowledge and attitudes involved in successful selling. To improve sales performance requires 
                        periodically examining all of these areas. The Sales IQ Plus assessment offers an objective analysis to answer the question, "What is keeping this person from selling more?"

                    <h3>The Eight Primary Sales Competencies</h3>

                    <p>
                        A sales "competency" is a category of selling proficiency that contains a number of different skills and knowledge components. 
                        By assessing your effectiveness in each of these areas, you will gain critical insight into your sales competencies:

                    <p class="comp-body">
                        Preparing for the sale and preparing yourself. You can be well prepared with information and sales tools, but if you are not
                        in the appropriate frame of mind, or if you do not appear professional to the buyer, you might not get the sale.

                    <p class="comp-body">
                        Targeting explores the markets or groups you may target as prospective buyers. Then, we focus on the individuals with whom you 
                        will make contact. This includes the sales strategies and tactics you select for each target market.

                    <p class="comp-body">
                        Connecting is the initial sales contact step, where you must appeal to people intellectually so they will see you as a credible resource, and emotionally so that they will trust you. Without either, you may be inhibited from learning enough to effectively help them and make the sale.

                        Assessing needs and wants seeks to uncover what to sell and how to sell it, primarily through asking the right questions and listening for the answers. As they say, “In sales as in medicine, prescription before diagnosis is malpractice.”

                        Solving the buyer’s problem, or fulfilling their need, is where most sales attention has been placed in the past. During this step, you present your ideas and solutions, tell your stories, and demonstrate your product to show how your solution best meets their needs.

                    <p class="comp-body">
                        Confirming is the sales phase where you gain the prospect’s commitment to buy. Confirming is achieved only after you have shown 
                        the ability to solve the prospect’s problem. Historically, this has been known as “closing” the sale.

                        Assuring clients that what they’ve been promised will be received is critical to customer retention. This is where relationships are built - customer loyalty is earned when you give more than expected, simply because it’s in the best interest of your customer.

                        <p class="answer">
                            We recommend administering the Sales IQ Plus assessment three times each year. As you master one area of selling, another 
                            area might need your attention. Nobody can attend to all areas all of the time, so occasional check-ups will make a big 
                            difference in maintaining a constant state of self and sales improvement.

                        <h6 class="question">How can an upper-level sales leader or executive use Sales IQ Plus? What about a new or veteran sales professional?</h6>
                        <p class="answer">
                            Determine your organization's overall sales effectiveness and identify the most-needed training by having each of your sales people 
                            complete an assessment. As a Supervisor or Sales Manager, you can use Sales IQ Plus as a coaching tool, comparing your observations 
                            alongside a candidate's Sales IQ Developmental Chart to determine exactly which aspects of sales effectiveness they need to improve 
                            that are most relevant right now. You can be streamlined in your coaching, rather than general. Sales professionals can learn more 
                            about their current effectiveness in all aspects of selling to get a clear idea of which skills to refine first. Some skills may 
                            develop at different times and some skills may require additional modifications or attention for different circumstances. Whether 
                            new to sales or a seasoned salesperson, the Sales IQ Plus will provide you the objective means for honing your craft.
