                            Imagine investing in deeper personal awareness with the detailed information from the Emotional Intelligence 
                            self-assessment, and taking the opportunity to compare it with observer data collected from your colleagues, 
                            managers, direct reports, or anyone who would share an honest, thoughtful perspective on how they perceive you.

                    <h2>EIQ-2 360º Assessment</h2>
                    <p>
                        EIQ-2 assessments help users understand the correlation between the way they apply their emotional intelligence and the outcome of their interactions with others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Often the way we perceive ourselves and the way others perceive us can be two very different things. Even experienced business leaders will persist in communication 
                        and organizational practices with a belief that everyone recognizes their "obvious" intentions, while overlooking costly misinterpretations from different behavioral
                        styles, communication preferences and emotional expression.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What if you had an enhanced 360° view to tell you how others perceive you? With the help of honest and candid feedback, you can work to be sure that your intentions 
                    match your behavior and that others interpret your expression in the way you anticipate.
                    </p>

                        <h2>No Observer Maximums & One Low Price</h2>
                        <p>
                            The EIQ-2 360º allows individuals to enhance the traditional EIQ-2 self-assessment. Using the same questionnaire process, 
                            observers are asked to provide their perspective of your Emotional Intelligence to help you compare and contrast what you 
                            think you are doing and what they experience. The feedback is intended as a way to open conversations, highlighting areas 
                            of your personal interactions that may be an opportunity to build greater effectiveness. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of our 360º assessments allow users to run an unlimited number of observer assessments without any additional cost. 
                            You must have a minimum number, but whether you add ten observers or 300, you only pay the same low wholesale price.
                        </p>

                           The EIQ 360 report is designed to give you a holistic view of your own perceptions of your Emotional Intelligence abilities and skills and to 
                           compare and contrast them with observer data. Through collecting data from a variety of relationships and roles, you have a unique opportunity 
                           to examine how your EIQ is perceived by others. By opening yourself up to receiving candid feedback from colleagues, direct reports, clients, 
                           leadership, friends, family and anyone else you value feedback from, you can determine if you are expressing yourself, recognizing and managing 
                           your emotions and the emotions of others in ways that are as effective as possible.

                            they think that. How can I find out more about why they rated me this way?</h6>
                        <p class="answer">
                            Ask them! The report is intended to highlight the places in your emotional expression that are being perceived the way you hope, and to 
                            reveal places where things may be understood differently than you anticipate. Using that information as a starting point for discussion, 
                            if you are not sure about what you do or don’t do and how it works, that’s a great place to ask for clarity. The key to this conversation 
                            is that it must be safe for feedback to be shared. If you are unwilling to hear the feedback or become defensive, the conversation will 
                            not be as helpful or honest as it could be. However, if you come to the conversation with an authentic curiosity and a desire to learn more 
                            about what others are experiencing, you will find a wealth of information that you can use to build stronger, healthier relationships.

                        <p class="answer">
                            The feedback presented to you will be anonymous. You must have a minimum number of raters to maintain anonymity, so a 360 report will not 
                            generate if you have not received enough feedback from others. You can, however, invite as many people as you wish to provide their perceptions. 
                            There is no maximum, and the cost is the same whether you have 10 responses or 300. We always recommend having as many people rate you as possible. 
                            The more information, the better snapshot you have of how different individuals in various roles perceive you and respond to you.
