                            data collected from your colleagues, managers, direct reports, or anyone who would share an honest, thoughtful perspective on how they perceive you.

                    <h2>DISC 360° Assessment</h2>
                    <p>
                        Often the way we perceive ourselves and the way others perceive us can be two very different things. Even experienced business leaders will persist in communication 
                        and organizational practices with a belief that everyone recognizes their "obvious" intentions, while overlooking costly misinterpretations from different behavioral 
                        styles, communication preferences and emotional expression. What if you had an enhanced 360° view to tell you how others perceive you? With the help of honest and 
                        candid feedback, you can be confident that your intentions match your behavior and that others interpret your actions as they were intended.

                            Our DISC 360º allows individuals to enhance the traditional DISC self-assessment with observer data. Using the same questionnaire process, observers are asked to provide their perspective of 
                            your behavior and emotions, helping you discover disconnects between your intention and their experience. The feedback is intended as a way to open conversations, 
                            highlighting areas of your personal interactions that may offer an opportunity to build greater effectiveness.</P>
                            
                            <p>As with all of our 360º assessments, the DISC 360º allows users to collect an unlimited number of observer assessments at no additional cost. Whether you add the minimum 5 observers or 300,
                                 you only pay the same low wholesale price.

                            The DISC 360 report is designed to give you a holistic view of your own perceptions of behavior and emotions and to compare 
                            and contrast them with observer data. By collecting data from a variety of relationships and roles, you have a unique 
                            opportunity to evaluate and examine how your behavior and emotions are perceived by others. By opening yourself up to 
                            receiving feedback from colleagues, employees, direct reports, clients, leadership, friends, family, and anyone else you 
                            value feedback from, you are also able to determine if you are adapting your style in ways that are as effective as 
                            possible, based on environment, situation, and relationship.

                        <h6 class="question">DISC 360 gives me general information about what others think about me, but doesn’t really go into 
                            details about why they think that. How can I find out more about why they rated me this way?</h6>
                        <p class="answer">
                            Ask them! The DISC 360 is intended to highlight the places in your behavioral and emotional expression that are 
                            being perceived as you intended, and to reveal areas where your actions may be misunderstood. 
                            Use this information as a starting point for discussion and ask for clarifying questions. The key to this conversation is that it must be safe for feedback to be shared. 
                            If you are unwilling to hear the feedback or become defensive, the conversation will not be as helpful or honest as it could be. 
                            However, if you come to the conversation with authentic curiosity and a desire to learn more about what others are 
                            experiencing, you will find a wealth of information that you can use to build stronger relationships.

                        <h6 class="question">Will the information in the 360 be anonymous? How many raters do I need? </h6>
                        <p class="answer">
                            The feedback presented to you will be anonymous. You must have a minimum number of raters to maintain anonymity, 
                            so a 360 report will not generate if you have not received enough feedback from others. You can, however, 
                            invite as many people as you wish to provide their perceptions. There is no maximum, and the cost is the same 
                            whether you have 5 responses or 300. We always recommend having as many people rate you as possible. The more 
                            information, the better snapshot you have of how different individuals in various roles perceive you and respond to you.
