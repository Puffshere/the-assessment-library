                            The feedback presented in the report is anonymous. A minimum of three observer responses are

                            the 360° report will not generate until three responses are received. An unlimited number of
                            observers can be invited to
                            participate, and the cost is the same whether you have three observer responses or 300. We
                            recommend inviting as many observers
                            as possible for the best overall snapshot.
