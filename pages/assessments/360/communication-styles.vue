                    <h2>Why an Emotional Intelligence 360º Assessment?</h2>
                    <p>
                        What if you had an enhanced 360° view of the world? In other words, imagine having the ability 
                        to process the collective perceptions of how others see you. Often times, the way we perceive 
                        ourselves and the way others perceive us are two very different things. Even experienced 
                        business leaders will persist in communication and organizational practices with the belief 
                        that everyone recognizes their "obvious" intentions, while overlooking costly misinterpretations 
                        that stem from different behavioral styles. These handicaps have always been unfortunate 
                        workplace inefficiencies that couldn't be resolved — until now.

                        <h2>A 360° Assessment for "The Platinum Rule"</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Communication Styles assessment provides what is termed 360° functionality. A 360° 
                            assessment enables the user to compare their own self assessment results with the "observer 
                            assessments" compiled anonymously by dozens (even hundreds) of his/her colleagues. The result? 
                            An insightful report that bridges the gap between intention and perception. The Communication 
                            Styles user is enlightened and equipped with the knowledge to avoid the behavioral 
                            misunderstandings that can trigger workplace discord and interpersonal conflict.

                    <p>
                        How valuable would it be to know exactly how your co-workers, direct reports, supervisors and clients 
                        perceive you? Do you think it might substantially increase your compatibility with others?  Do you think 
                        it might measurably improve workplace communication and efficiencies? Decades of social science research 
                        tell us that the answer is YES.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Invite anyone to take the same assessment you just took— but anonymously— on your behalf. You simply type 
                        in the first name and email address of business colleagues, clients, friends and family; that’s it... We 
                        do the rest! We send your desired observers an email note inviting them to complete an anonymous “observer 
                        assessment” of your social style.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once all of these “observer assessments” are compiled by our system, you are able to view your own Communication 
                        Styles eGraph that plots all the different ways people anonymously assessed you. You’ll gain incredible insights 
                        by contrasting how your colleagues see you at-large, versus how you had perceived yourself.

                           It’s always best to begin with the self. Self-Recognition is the foundation to Self-Management because if we don’t understand it, 
                           how can it be managed? Social awareness and building strong relationships with others spring from our understanding of self. 
                           All four of the quotients are interrelated and will impact each other. Therefore, if Self-Recognition is strong, we are more 
                           likely to appropriately understand and interact with others.

                            Absolutely! For some it may seem “touchy-feely” or “too emotional,” but EIQ goes so far beyond just the soft skill applications. 
                            High EIQ benefits our communication, decision-making, leadership abilities, sales, teamwork and team performance, productivity, 
                            relationship satisfaction, customer service, conflict management and overall effectiveness! Who wouldn’t want that at work?

                            There are a few different reputable models of EIQ out there, and you may find that some speak to you and your needs
