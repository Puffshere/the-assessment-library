                            Performance Gap Indicator (PGI) evaluates five company-wide performance areas, with separate reporting 
                            for initial analysis and subsequent follow-up, so you can objectively track progress and demonstrate real ROI.

                    <p>
                        Business leaders can easily misreport the source of their organization’s challenges. The sales team may be underperforming, 
                        but is it due to a lack of adequate training or operations? Employee retention is slipping, but is that stemming from culture 
                        or leadership? Before PGI, organizations and consultants were forced to rely on manual discovery processes to find the answers 
                        to their greatest and most impactful challenges. When done correctly, the process had always been time consuming, expensive and 
                        prone to human error. With the PGI, key information is quickly determined and immediately accessible to start making a difference 
                        in identified performance gaps.

                    <blockquote>
                        "The Performance Gap Indicator (PGI) is a remarkable assessment to (a) get your foot in the door, and (b) provide an organization 
                        with a MRI of what's ailing it. Once the "MRI" is completed, consultants and trainers will know which departments and professionals 
                        require training AND which Core Assessments to use with them."<br/><br/>
                        "It's the perfect company-wide (or department wide) assessment to "set the table" for your training initiatives with laser targeted accuracy and objective insights."<br/><br/>

                    <p>
                        The Performance Gap Indicator (PGI) allows you to measure performance and identify critical company-wide issues. 
                        Within a single report, PGI allows you to analyze five core performance metrics and identify areas for improvement. 
                        The PGI anonymously combines individual employee responses and analyzes them across each of five Non-Financial Key 
                        Performance Indicators (NF-KPIs) for a multi-faceted and revealing look at an organization’s strengths and performance 
                        gaps. More than a standard one-dimensional company culture tool, PGI examines culture, operations, leadership, training 
                        and service to build a holistic look at what’s happening within the company.
