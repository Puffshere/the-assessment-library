                    <p>
                        This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of our Assessments 24x7 software ("Software") directly 
                        from Assessment Business Center or indirectly through a Assessment Business Center authorized reseller or 
                        distributor (a "Reseller").
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the installation process and using the 
                        Assessments 24x7 software. It provides a license to use the Assessments 24x7 software and contains warranty 
                        information and liability disclaimers. If you register for a free trial of the Assessments 24x7 software, 
                        this EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the 
                        Assessments 24x7 software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound 
                        by the terms of this EULA agreement.

                        you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do not have 
                        such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not install or 
                        use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by Assessment Business Center herewith regardless 
                        of whether other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Assessment Business
