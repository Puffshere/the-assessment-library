                    <p>
                        We may use your personal data, (i.e. your first name, email and assessment responses,) to produce a personalized 
                        assessment report about you. For each visitor to our website, our web server automatically recognizes the 
                        visitor's domain name and email address (where possible.) We do not collect all of that data, but it is recognized. 
                        We collect only the domain name, but not the email address, of visitors to our website. We also track aggregate 
                        information on what pages visitors access or visit, and user-specific information on what pages visitors access 
                        or visit. When someone visits our sites, a cookie is placed on the visitor's computer, (if the customer accepts 
                        cookies,) or is read if the visitor has previously visited the site.

                    <p>
                        We collect information you give us; the names and email addresses of those who take our online assessments, the 
                        email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, survey information and/or site registrations. We do 
                        not collect or track the email addresses of those who are asked to be observers, (for our 360 degree assessments 
                        only,) of those who purchase the online assessment. Email addresses are not sold or traded, now or in the future, 
                        for any reason, and no one will be contacted unless they specifically request it. The information we collect is 
                        used to improve the content of our website, to notify consumers about updates to our website and used by us to 
                        contact visitors for marketing purposes.
