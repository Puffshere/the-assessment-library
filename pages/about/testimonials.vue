                                One of the best business decisions I made as a certified coach was to explore the solutions offered by Assessments 24x7. 
                                The online certification courses, forums, training materials and support are world-class. Additionally, the assessment 
                                reports are personally branded and easy to assess. Working with Assessments 24x7 has supercharged my coaching practice 
                                and they've become an integral extension of my professional service offering. I highly recommend Assessments 24x7 to 
                                any coach, consultant, or corporate trainer looking for a one-stop solution that will ensure their business continues 
                                to innovate and stay forward-thinking.

                                I am happy to say that we use Assessments 24x7 as our global DISC solution. We started to work with Assessments 24x7 because we were interested in 
                                the breadth of instruments that they offer. There are instruments for a large variety of cases and lots of different team
                                dynamics. Since then, we have been really happy with the ease of using their platform. We have also been happy with the 
                                customer service that we have been provided. Every question that we have ever asked the team has been responded to really 
                                quickly and professionally. That gives Assessments 24x7 our highest recommendation.

                                One of the main reasons that I chose Assessments 24x7 is that I found their tools to be extremely powerful, intuitive to

                                I researched many assessment companies and worked with two others over the years. But when I discovered Assessments 24x7 
                                and the breadth and depth of tools available, I decided to go all-in. Working with Dr. Tony Alessandra and his team can be

                                company with 17 coaches we all help our clients hire people for their teams, each client is given a specific URL that allows their coach as well as the client to review 
                                DISC assessments. It has been tremendous in streamlining our clients' hiring processes and while keeping each coach involved.<br/><br/>

                                I chose Assessments 24x7 for these principle reasons:<br/><br/>

                                (1) Their response to my initial query was immediate, and the simple straightforwardness of their materials communicated a 
                                member-friendly process with ease and clarity.<br/><br/>

                                (2) My very first consultation with a member of their leadership team was surprising. He exhibited an aura that made our 
                                meetings comfortable and pressure free. It was as if we'd already met at least four times. I appreciated the ease and 
                                integrity of his communication style.<br/><br/>

                                (3) The PDFs designed to showcase their process was user friendly, to the point, and detailed enough. Enough for me 
                                comfortably make the decision to quickly purchase.<br/><br/>

                                (4) Most importantly, the support and guidance the entire Assessments 24x7 team offers newbies. I appreciate not being 
                                thrown to the wolves! They ensured my comfort throughout their simple and streamlined process.<br/><br/>

                                Again, thank you Assessments 24x7. I'm looking forward to your certification training and a lifelong partnership!

                                Partnering with Assessments 24x7 is what got my business off the ground. I can still recall my first contact with the 
                                company. Jenifer Larson, VP of Instructional Design and Education, talked with me, heard me, and came up with just what 
                                I needed to move my business to the next step. Getting certified in all 5 assessments and being included in their group 
                                of Advanced Certified Practitioners, not only gave me clout, it gave me exposure too; it was just like free marketing 
                                from a bigger, more established company. The customer service was, and continues to be, above and beyond. At my first 
                                workshop, they sent Mark to come help get the bugs out and actually present with me. It is those acts of attention that 
                                built my confidence, my presentation skills and my reputation. I have had many needs and each one has been met - every

                                As an Executive Coach, I enrolled in the DISC certification to offer more assessment options for my clients. I found the 
                                course engaging, accessible, and thorough in its approach to communication styles and how to adapt for better 
                                conversations. The debriefing and mentoring was also top notch and your support continues to be much more than I expected. 
                                Besides getting more than my money's worth, I feel very inspired to use these tools with my clients. Thank you!

                                online admin pages are straightforward and easy use. End users find it simple to access the link and complete their assessments. 
                                Each report is very detailed, yet straightforward and presented simply for the user to understand. Therefore, I can highly recommend

                                Working with everyone at Assessments 24x7 was a terrific experience. I felt supported throughout the training, especially the wide 
                                variety of examples provided in the debriefs of each assessment. This, to me, was paramount to bounce back ideas, and have a more 
                                in-depth overall exposure to different scenarios.

                                We began using the Assessments 24x7 'Unlimited DISC Plan' as a way to simplify our assessment offering. 
                                It has made it much easier to offer assessments to our clients, as well as using them in our marketing campaigns. 
                                For our clients who use our assessments regularly, we are now able to offer them an Annual Subscription with quantity pricing. 
                                We just send them a code, and can easily monitor their usage. No more billing and collecting for one-off assessments. 
                                Thanks Dr. Tony for this valuable offering!

                                Quality and professionalism are hallmarks of my business, so I extensively researched the world's leading DISC providers 
                                before choosing the Assessments 24x7 DISC assessment. Their reports are superior in both content and presentation. 
                                I was especially impressed with the quality of the reports' modern design and engaging graphics. This is a product I 
                                am proud to offer as part of my consulting work. The "icing on the cake" is I can fully personalize the reports with

                                As part of the departmental leadership team at my university, I had the pleasure of taking the DISC assessment.  Not only 
                                did I learn about my own style, but about my colleagues' styles.  Since our time debriefing our results, we have 
                                developed a common language to talk through our strengths and weaknesses as a group.  Seeing the power it had to unify and 
                                develop our leadership group, I had my own team take the DISC assessment.  We had positive results again! We found the 
                                debrief with our practitioner to be engaging and informative.  Two weeks later, we shared our DISC results in a team 
                                meeting. Again, having the common language of DISC helped us achieve a level of vulnerability and understanding we 
                                hadn't had in the past. As a fairly new leader, I have been so pleased with the  DISC tool to help my team learn about 
                                themselves and one another.  I know it's my job to understand the natural style of each of my team members and help them 
                                develop into the best they can be.  Using the DISC gave me insight as a leader that I couldn't find anywhere else.
