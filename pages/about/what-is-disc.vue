                            DISC is one of the most widely-used performance enhancement tools, by companies large and small, to achieve their goals. As the 
                            leading self-assessment tool, millions of people use it annually to improve productivity, teamwork, and communication.

                    <blockquote>
                        A smooth and high-functioning workplace does not happen by accident. It requires an intentional blending of talent, 
                        motivation, clearly communicated and understood objectives, and much more to reach optimum performance.

                    <p>
                        The DISC profile is a simple, practical, and easy-to-remember model that focuses on individual patterns of observable behavior and 
                        emotions. It measures the intensity of characteristics using scales of directness, openness, pace, and priority to create a unique 
                        blend of four behavioral styles:
                    </p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dominance (D)</li>
                            <li>Influence (I)</li>
                            <li>Steadiness (S)</li>
                            <li>Conscientiousness (C)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        When a person uses the DISC model, they can identify their own blend of styles, recognize and adapt to the styles of others, 
                        and develop a better communication process that allows them to interact effectively with others to build mutually beneficial 
                        relationships. This is applicable in any setting, including working with teams, sales, leadership, or in 
                        other business and personal relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using DISC can provide insight into behavioral tensions, causes of stress, problem-solving, and ways to respond more effectively to 
                        conflict. When these items are identified for each individual, it leads to better relationships, both personally and professional. 
                        For example, salespeople using DISC can develop finely-tuned selling skills based on identifying and responding to a customer's 
                        style. In personal relationships, understanding the needs, emotions, and fears of others can help us build mutually-beneficial 
                        partnerships.

                    <h3 class="title">What is the DISC Assessment used for?</h3>
                    <p>
                        DISC teaches users how to identify the predictable aspects of behavior and communication and to use that knowledge to their advantage. 
                        The ability to create a strong and immediate connection with others is a fundamental skill in sales, management, executive-level leadership, 
                        and everyday life. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The goal of DISC is to help users build and maximize productive relationships. Users don’t need to change their personality traits; they need 
                        to recognize what drives and motivates others and determine the best ways to effectively interact with them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The comprehensive, yet simple, DISC reports teach users specific skills to improve their personal interactions that create immediate results.
                    </p>

                <h3 class="title">Who Created DISC?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dr. William Moulton Marston was a lawyer and a physiological psychologist who first shared the DISC model in his 1928 book Emotions of Normal People.  
                        A man of many talents, Marston was also credited with helping to contribute to the first polygraph test, creating the character Wonder Woman, 
                        and authoring several self-help books.
                    </p>
                           
                    <p>
                        Marston conducted research on human emotions, and based on those findings, postulated that people illustrate their emotions using the behavior 
                        types of Dominance (D), Inducement (I), Submission (S), and Compliance (C), or DISC for short.
                    </p>    
                    
                    <p>
                        It was his belief that these behavioral types came from people's sense of self and their interaction with the environment.  In addition, 
                        he included two dimensions that influence people’s emotional behavior:
                    </p>  
                    
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The first dimension was whether people view their environment as favorable or unfavorable.</li>
                            <li>The second dimension was whether a person perceives himself as having control or lack of control over his environment.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Marston did not create an actual assessment tool from his theories, but based on his work, others did.  In 1956, Walter Clarke, an industrial 
                        psychologist first constructed an assessment that confirmed Marston’s theories.  He created the Activity Vector Analysis, a psychometric tool 
                        that was designed for use by businesses to help them choose qualified employees.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 1965, DISC findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology.  The test format continued to evolve when a "Self-Description" 
                        test forced respondents to make a choice between two or more terms.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        While the assessments used today have evolved from the original work of Marston and Clarke, the same premise of four behavioral styles is 
                        used as the foundation and the continued development of the tools to embrace new science all the time comes from a rich history.

                    <p>
                        The DISC model uses four behavioral reference points.  A formal assessment goes much deeper, but an overview of the four styles are:

                            When communicating with a C-style individual, focus on facts and details; minimize "pep talk" or emotional language; be patient, persistent, and diplomatic. 
                            C styles need time to process and respond so be sure to allow time for them to gather their thoughts and resources to formulate the best response they can offer.

                    <h3 class="title">How DISC Behavior Assessments Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        The good news about DISC assessments is that there are no right or wrong answers. They're also simple to take online, with some assessments taking as little as 10 minutes to complete.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Although a person’s Natural profile tends to stay fairly consistent over time, the Adapted style can change based on the environment, situation, or relationship and is a reflection 
                        of a moment in time. Some may consider taking the assessment again several years apart because the accuracy of the assessment itself is continually improved. Keep in mind, changes 
                        to behavioral style can also occur due to seasons of life and emotional experiences. It’s always a good idea to continue to evaluate your behavioral patterns to build awareness of 
                        how you are responding to various situations, environments, and relationships.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Scoring and reporting can either be done electronically or in a few simple steps if you take a paper version of the assessment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Taking a DISC assessment involves answering a questionnaire about your own behavior by choosing descriptors most like you and least like you. From your selections, 
                        an algorithm returns your personal behavioral blend and your scores produce a profile report. You'll be able to read about your unique behavioral style, your tendencies, 
                        needs, preferred environment for greatest opportunities to be effective, and strategies for adapting behavior appropriately with others. You will also learn more about your 
                        strengths and potential challenges.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Reports also include insights about other DISC styles so you can learn more about how others act and what their strengths and weaknesses are as well.  When you do this in a work team 
                        setting, you will end up with a greater understanding of your workplace colleagues to help you with effective communication strategies going forward.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Some people are concerned that DISC profiles can place unfair labels on people.  For example, you might have heard someone dismiss someone’s action or comments with a 
                        remark like “She’s a D, what do you expect?” Assigning labels and rationalizing poor behavior are not what DISC profiles are about. Not all D styles behave or respond in the same way, 
                        especially when we consider the style blend. A DC will behave differently than a DI, even though their primary style is the same. DISC simply helps people better understand behavioral 
                        and communication preferences and priorities.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <h3 class="title">Which DISC Profile or Vendor is Best?</h3>        
                    
                    <p>
                        The assessment industry is largely unregulated and DISC is what's termed “open-source research.” This means anyone can produce an assessment and call it a DISC profile.
                    </p> 
                    
                    <p>
                        As a result, the scientific accuracy of DISC profiles varies widely. We recommend only considering DISC profiles that have published validity & reliability studies. Even 
                        among providers with validated DISC profiles, the scope and quality of the reporting can vary widely. So, we recommend narrowing one's search to validated DISC profiles only, 
                        then comparing those providers’ sample reports. Other important considerations include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is the technology provided by the DISC profile provider to purchase, deliver, and manage the assessments?</li>
                        <li>Which validated DISC profile providers offer certification programs that are independently recognized and accredited by continuing education institutions like <a href="https://coachfederation.org" class="hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICF</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.shrm.org" class="hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHRM</a>, <a href="https://www.hrci.org" class="hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HRCI</a> and <a href="https://www.td.org" class="hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATD</a>?</li>
                        <li>What are the DISC profile costs?</li>
                        <li>Are DISC profile team reports and trainer materials included?</li>
                    </ul>
                            
                    <p>
                        Look for options to choose profiles focused on your general self-awareness and understanding or specific areas including management, leadership, sales, or service to name a few.
                    </p>  
                    
                    <p>
                        Another consideration could be how to differentiate yourself from other coaches or professionals with the product. For example, you can take your career to the next level by <nuxt-link class="hyperlink" to="/certifications">becoming a Certified DISC Practitioner</nuxt-link>. 
                        At Assessments 24x7, becoming DISC Certified is just one of the many development options offered.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        Lastly, examine the other programs and assessments available to support your clients and customers. At Assessments 24x7, there are <nuxt-link class="hyperlink" to="/certifications/assessment">five Core Assessment certification programs</nuxt-link>, designed 
                        specifically for coaches and corporate trainers, including DISC, Motivators, HVP, Emotional Intelligence, and Learning Styles. Each self-paced, flexible training program includes 1-on-1 instructor-led sessions (via Zoom or Skype) for your convenience.
                    </p> 
                </div>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <h3 class="title">How Long Does the DISC Assessment Take?</h3>

                    <p>
                        In most cases, it takes 10-15 minutes to complete the questionnaire.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you begin the assessment, you will make 26 selections of the words or phrases that are most like you and the words or phrases that are least like you. From these choices, the report algorithm 
                        determines the balance of your DISC blend and returns the comprehensive report tool.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is important to note that not all vendors will have the same DISC assessment process. Some offer computer adaptive testing with up to 80 questions, and others provide a 28-item forced-choice questionnaire.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because DISC is not a copyrighted model, vendors are free to use their own process. However, there are only a small handful of valid, scientifically-backed versions of DISC assessments out there. 
                        Be sure you examine the validity of the tools and pay special attention to the last time the data was validated.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <h3 class="title">What Does DISC Measure?</h3>

                    <p>
                        DISC measures observable behavior and emotions. It does not measure intelligence, education, experience, aptitude, mental health, or values.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You may gain greater insight into how you respond to challenges, how you influence and interact with others, how you operate at your preferred pace, and how 
                        well you follow directions and function with structure in place, as well as many other tendencies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you are aware of these dimensions and know how to apply them effectively, you can use  your style strengths or modify your style weaknesses to meet your needs and the needs of others.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>A DISC report has three parts:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Part I</strong> helps you understand each DISC style and identifies characteristics, including the tendencies of each behavioral style. The overview of the model is provided to help you with a strong

                            <strong>Part III</strong> explores adaptability and offers actionable recommendations for you and others who interact with you. This section is designed as a resource to assist you in communicating more effectively 
                            with others and includes multiple tools to help you practice your new DISC knowledge and guide your continued development and implementation in your everyday environments.
