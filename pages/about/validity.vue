                       A recent review revealed <strong>a significant majority of assessments available today lacked
                       the studies & reporting to confirm their accuracy.</strong> Of the small minority which claimed reporting, 
                       the significant majority of those were conducted privately; oftentimes by the assessment provider 
                       itself, rather than an objective and scientifically qualified third party. At Assessments24x7, we are leading 
                       by example in this otherwise unregulated industry. How are we doing this? By submitting our 
                       assessments to an objective, independently conducted battery of tests: Construct Validity, 
                       Reliability, and Disparate Impact - all by a qualified scientific authority

                    <h3>The Assessment Industry’s Past and Present</h3>
                    <p>
                        Assessments have been used since the mid-20th century, initially relied upon by Fortune 500s, calculated by 
                        highly skilled PhDs, and produced by only a handful of trusted developers. With the advent of the internet in 
                        the 1990s, the ability to produce, market, and sell assessments became exponentially easier and less expensive. 
                        Since then, it has developed into a kind of “global cottage industry” with hundreds of new assessment developers 
                        producing thousands of different assessments. Each developer purporting its assessments to be scientifically 
                        accurate instruments - sold, resold, and used by individuals and organizations of all kinds; including many of
                        our largest institutions like Fortune 500 companies, major universities, world governments, and the military. 
                        Frighteningly, this “global cottage industry,” which produces data relied upon by millions, is entirely 
                        unregulated with nothing to ensure its consumers are receiving what they are being told and sold. 
                        There are zero requirements, safeguards, laws, or regulations ensuring the consumer receives a 
                        scientifically accurate instrument - or even what the developers and sellers claim.

                    <h4>Construct Validity (APA Standards)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Construct validity is one of the most central concepts in psychology. It is the degree to which 
                        a test measures what it claims, or purports to be measuring. Researchers generally establish 
                        the construct validity of a measure by correlating it with a number of other measures and 
                        arguing from the pattern of correlations that the measure is associated with these variables 
                        in theoretically predictable ways.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Reliability - Cronbach’s alpha  (APA Standards)</h4>
                    <p>
                        This technique is regarded as one of the most robust measures of reliability and presents the highest 
                        'bar' from which to compare. The readers should note that Cronbach's alpha is the method selected 
                        for this instrument, because of its high standards. The reader is encouraged to compare reliability 
                        coefficients presented herein to other vendors, and also to ask those vendors which reliability formulas 
                        they used to compute their reliability coefficients. Cronbach’s alpha is a measure used to assess the 
                        reliability, or internal consistency, of a set of scale or test items. In other words, the reliability 
                        of any given measurement refers to the extent to which it is a consistent measure of a concept, and 
                        Cronbach’s alpha is one way of measuring the strength of that consistency.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Disparate Impact (EEOC Standards)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Employers often use tests and other selection procedures to screen applicants for hire and employees 
                        for promotion. The use of tests and other selection procedures can be a very effective means of 
                        determining which applicants or employees are most qualified for a job. However, use of these tools 
                        can also violate the EEOC Guidelines if they disproportionately exclude people in a protected group 
                        by class, race, sex, or another covered basis. Importantly, the law does allow for selection procedures 
                        to select the best candidates based on job-related requirements. If the selection procedure has a 
                        disparate impact based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, the employer is required 
                        to show that the selection procedure is job related and consistent with business necessity. 
                        If discrimination exists, the challenged policy or practice should therefore be associated with 
                        the skills needed to perform the job successfully.
