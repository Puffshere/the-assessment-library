Sales success requires that you be highly effective in two areas:<br>
• Making sales<br>
• Managing yourself as a sales person<br>
<br>
There are a multitude of skills, behaviors, knowledge and attitudes involved in 
any successful sales career. To know how to improve your own sales performance 
requires that you look at all of them from time to time. The 
SalesEffectiveness360 (SE360) is your tool for doing a quick self-assessment and 
for gaining the input of others as well.<br>
<br>
This instrument consists of a simple set of 32 questions that guide you in 
assessing each of the eight primary sales competencies. A sales &quot;competency&quot; is 
a category of selling proficiency that contains a number of different skill and 
knowledge components. All eight competencies combine to provide an overview of 
your selling effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Four questions explore each competency from a variety of perspectives. For 
example: in &quot;preparation&quot; the competency is explored by questions related to 
Sales Preparation as well as Self Preparation. Sales preparation is addressed 
externally, outside your own company, and internally, within your company. 
Self-preparation is addressed from the standpoint of mental preparation and 
physical preparation. A similar pattern is applied to all eight competencies.<br>
<br>
What this means to you is that when you want to increase your sales results, 
rather than just making more calls or being more persuasive in your 
presentations, you can identify exactly which of the 32 aspects of selling on 
which to focus. You can be surgical in your focus rather than general. For 
example: Your limiting factor may be in who you have targeted as prospects or in 
how you are trying to build credibility with them. Alternatively, it may be in 
the questions you are asking to determine a prospect&#39;s needs or even in the way 
you answer questions.<br>
<br>
By assessing your sales effectiveness in each area, you will gain an overview 
that allows you to be a much better self-manager as well as a better sales 
person.<br>
<br>
This SalesEffectiveness360 assessment should be done at least three times each 
year. As you master one area of selling, another area might need your attention. 
Nobody can attend to all areas all of the time, so occasional check-ups will 
make a big difference in keeping you in a constant state of improvement.<br>
<br>
The Observer component of the SE360 is of big value. By seeking an assessment 
from others, i.e., a sales coach, manager, coworker, friend or key client, you 
will expand your awareness profoundly. Even though you may know yourself very 
well, the observations of others about your skills or behaviors can tell you 
much that would never have occurred to you by using only your own point of view.<br>
<br>
Three possible outcomes will be evident in your SE360. When you see the chart 
displaying your self-assessment side by side with the assessments from your 
observers, you will see:</font></span></p>
<p class="P39"><span class="T45">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
1. Areas on which you agree that things are going fine<br>
2. Areas on which you agree that improvement is needed<br>
3. Areas on which you disagree about the need<br>
<br>
With the agreement that things are fine, your best path is to continue as is. 
With the agreement that improvement is needed, your next step is to decide 
specifically what and how to improve. In addition, with disagreement as to 
whether improvement is needed or not, you can focus on exploring the situation 
to see whose view is most accurate.<br>
<br>
The major aspects of each sales area are identified for you in this report and 
are directly related to each of the 32 key areas of sales effectiveness.
