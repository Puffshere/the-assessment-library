											Most people know that the measure of 
											a salesperson’s success is their 
											ability to make new sales. However, 
											how can a sales manager or 
											organization predict a sales 
											professional’s current skill level? 
											Likewise, how can sales 
											professionals see through the opaque 
											lens of self-bias and identify their 
											own areas of improvement, while 
											finding the practical solutions for 
											correcting them? </font></p>
											<p class="P39">
											<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
											As with any profession, selling has 
											a body of knowledge related to 
											successful execution. There are a 
											multitude of skills, behaviors, 
											knowledge and attitudes involved in 
											any successful sales career. To know 
											how to improve your own sales 
											performance requires that you 
											periodically examine all of these 
											aspects. The Sales IQ Plus 
											assessment offers such an objective 
											analysis and essentially answers the 
											question, “Can this person sell?”

											Top Sales &amp; Marketing Awards Silver 
											medal Assessment ToolThis 
											award-winning sales skill assessment 
											was jointly developed by 
											best-selling authors Jeffrey Gitomer 
											(The Sales Bible,) Jim Cathcart 
											(Relationship Selling) and Dr. Tony 
											Alessandra (The Platinum Rule for 
											DISC Sales Mastery.) Borrowing upon 
											the wisdom and experience of these 
											three authorities, Sales IQ Plus 
											measures a sales professional’s 
											understanding of the strategies 
											required to sell successfully in any 
											environment.</font></p>
											<p class="P39">
											<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
											This assessment takes approximately 
											30 minutes to complete and consists 
											of 48 questions that guide you in 
											assessing each of the eight primary 
											sales competencies, along with some 
											vital selling traits. A sales 
											&quot;competency&quot; is a category of 
											selling proficiency that contains a 
											number of different skills and 
											knowledge components. All eight 
											competencies combine to provide an 
											overview of your current selling 
											effectiveness.</font></p>
											<p class="P39">
											<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
											Each of the eight primary 
											competencies is explored from a 
											variety of perspectives:</font></p>
											<ul>
												<li>
												<p class="P39">
												<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
												<b>Preparing</b> for the sale 
												and preparing yourself. You can 
												be well prepared with 
												information and sales tools, but 
												if you are not in the 
												appropriate frame of mind, or if 
												you do not appear professional 
												to the buyer, you might not get 
												the sale.</font></p></li>
												<li>
												<p class="P39">
												<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
												<b>Targeting</b> explores the 
												markets or groups you may target 
												as prospective buyers. Then, we 
												focus on the individuals with 
												whom you will make contact. This 
												includes the sales strategies 
												and tactics you select for each 
												target market. Poor targeting 
												with great selling skills would 
												result in limited success 
												because you would be selling to 
												the wrong people.</font></p>
												</li>
												<li>
												<p class="P39">
												<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
												<b>Connecting</b> is the initial 
												sales contact step, where you 
												must appeal to people 
												intellectually so they will see 
												you as a credible resource, and 
												emotionally so that they will 
												trust you as a person. Without 
												either, you are inhibited from 
												learning enough about them to 
												solve their problems and make a 
												sale.</font></p></li>
												<li>
												<p class="P39">
												<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
												<b>Assessing</b> needs and wants 
												uncovers what to sell and how to 
												sell it, primarily through 
												probing and listening. As they 
												say, “In sales as in medicine, 
												prescription before diagnosis is 
												malpractice.”</font></p></li>
												<li>
												<p class="P39">
												<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
												<b>Solving</b> the buyer’s 
												problem, or filling their need, 
												is where most of the sales 
												attention has been placed in the 
												past. This is the part where you 
												present your solutions, tell 
												your stories, demonstrate your 
												product or describe the outcomes 
												that buying will produce. At its 
												lowest level, this is a sales 
												pitch. At its highest level, 
												this is a dialogue where you 
												prove there is great value for 
												them in buying from you.</font></p>
												</li>
												<li>
												<p class="P39">
												<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
												<b>Confirming</b> is the sales 
												phase where you gain the 
												prospect’s commitment to buy. 
												Confirming is achieved only 
												after you have shown the ability 
												to solve the prospect’s problem. 
												Historically, this has been 
												known as “closing” the sale, but 
												the truth is that it is not an 
												end, but the beginning. It is at 
												this point that the sales 
												professional begins serving the 
												customer and they, in turn, 
												begin paying for the value they 
												receive.</font></p></li>
												<li>
												<p class="P39">
												<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
												<b>Assuring</b> clients that the 
												value promised will be received 
												is critical to customer 
												retention. This is where 
												relationships are built and 
												customer loyalty is to be given 
												(by you) more than expected 
												(from them).</font></p></li>
												<li>
												<p class="P39">
												<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
												<b>Managing</b> is the final 
												phase of the sales cycle, where 
												you manage sales and accounts 
												and self-manage yourself. 
												Ultimately, we are all our own 
												‘sales manager’. This is the 
												phase of selling where you must 
												make yourself do what needs to 
												be done, even when you do not 
												feel like doing it.</font></p>
