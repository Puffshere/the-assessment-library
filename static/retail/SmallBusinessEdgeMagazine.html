operate on you without first reviewing MRI images, X-rays or other evaluations? 
Of course you wouldn’t! Smart business people use online assessments to make 
decisions about personal and personnel development, hiring and job matching, 
promoting, team-building and leading others. You can think of online assessments 
as “MRI tests” to reveal someone’s innermost values (why they do what they do), 
behavioral tendencies (how they do what they do) and skill sets (how to tailor 
training to get them to do what they do better).</font></p>

<b>The Job Fitness Rating Report
</b></font>
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<br>
<br>
The purpose of the Job Fitness Report is to show decision makers how they can 
understand the contribution of behavioral fitness to job effectiveness and how 
to use that understanding in interpreting past behavioral job effectiveness as 
well as making better decisions in the future. Understanding behavioral fitness 
offers the practical power of being able to focus their attention and make 
distinctions regarding the strength of the behavioral fitness between a specific 
job and the candidate’s/individuals behavioral style. </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
The Job Fitness Rating is a measure that evaluates the strength of the 
behavioral relationship between a job candidate and the more typical behaviors 
required by a job. The Job Fitness Rating integrates all four (4) dimensions of 
DISC into an overall measure that reflects the strengths of the behavioral 
similarities and/or differences to maximize behavioral effectiveness on the job. </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
The fitness rating is scored on a scale between 1% and 100%. The fitness rating 
represents the strength of the relationship between the candidate’s behavioral 
style and the behavioral requirements of a specific job. The higher the fitness 
rating, the more able the candidate’s natural behavioral style can be applied to 
the task of getting the job done consistent to the job profile.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39" align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/fitgraph.png"></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">A 
behavioral style itself is not so much what the individual thinks or says about 
a person, thing or idea. It’s your observation of how that individual tends to 
act toward people, things and ideas.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">The 
behavioral style fitness rating places a candidate’s fitness compared to a 
specific job benchmark on a (3) three-level rating system. The (3) level rating 
system ranges from limited to excellent to further clarify the fitness rating.
</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
Consider the fitness rating score like a score you are familiar with on a scale 
from 1 to 100. The higher the fitness rating score, the more confident you can 
be that the desired behaviors you want for a specific job will be observable 
with this candidate/individual. The lower the fitness rating, the more confident 
you can be that the desired behaviors you want for a specific job will not be 
observable with the candidate/individual.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">A 
fitness rating of .75% means that the candidate and the job profile share .75% 
of the target behaviors whereas 25% of the behavioral style is different. To 
understand which behaviors are similar or different, look at the 12 factors and 
four factor details on page 4 of the sample report.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">An 
Excellent Fitness Ratings means the employee/candidate will spend less energy 
thinking about how to adapt their behaviors to the behaviors required of the 
targeted job role and allow their more natural behaviors to create results.
</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">A 
Good Fitness Rating means the employee/candidate will need to be reminded from 
time to time of their behavioral effectiveness in their role. </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">A 
Limited Fitness Rating means the employee/candidate will need to facilitate 
their behavioral effectiveness through consistent timely feedback and 
structures. The lack of quality feedback regarding an individual’s behavioral 
distance from a specific job requirement has the potential of creating a false 
illusion that their behaviors are effective which reinforces their current 
behavior.</font></span></p>

Judgment Assessment</font></b></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
It is an irrefutable fact that people have biases and blind spots in their 
processing and judgment ability. The work in neuroscience has demonstrated over 
30+ biases to date, let alone the research that most eyewitnesses can be wrong 
over 75% of the time. It has also been documented that people who have better 
judgment make better decisions and have better social and personal intelligence 
that leads to better relationships and better well-being. If understanding our 
judgment is so fundamental to our decision making, relationships, and personal 
well-being, we should all be working at understanding what potential biases and 
blind spots we have so we can continue to remove them from our everyday lives 
and improve our judgment ability. </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
The best way to improve your judgment is to get outside opinions of it and get 
feedback on how accurate it is. It is from gaining new perspectives of awareness 
that we are then consciously able to make improvement. The JUDGMENT<i><b>compass
</b></i>report has been built from a science that allows for an unbiased 
evaluation of your judgment. Unlike most self-report tests, this assessment 
gains understanding about your judgment ability by making you make judgments. 
You will be able to answer the following questions:</font></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
	<font color="#800000"><b>How OBSERVANT are you?</b></font> What is your 
	capacity to naturally pick up on all of information when not directly 
	focusing on it? What selective biases to you have?</font></span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
	<font color="#800000"><b>How OPEN are you?</b></font> How receptive are you 
	to information you receive? Do you tend to see more of the good or the bad? 
	Do you tend to be open and positive or more guarded and skeptical?</font></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
	<font color="#800000"><b>How RESOURCEFUL are you?</b></font> How well can 
	you sort through the information you receive and what you know to set 
	priorities and solve problems? </font></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
The report is built to not only be descriptive of your judgment strengths by 
indicating your judgment style, but also prescriptive as it will give you 
suggestions for how to reduce potential errors in your judgment that may be 
affecting your performance. If you are about to invest money and time in an 
assessment, this report is certain to provide you with information that will 
give you a new understanding of yourself and strategies for how to make 
improvements. Sometimes the new awareness alone of what influences your judgment 
can make instant changes in performance. </font></span></p>

<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<u><b>Critical Thinking</b></u><b> is the first and most important performance multiplier</b>. It has 
the unique ability to calculate decision
speed, the capacity to work effectively with others and make the right decisions 
while operating within the established framework
of an organization.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
The critical thinking measure is based upon the Nobel nominated research into 
human decision theory and is comprised of three
sophisticated algorithms that calculate and measure an individual’s capacity to 
make the correct choices when faced with the
problems, challenges and opportunities they encounter <i>(when applied to their areas of expertise).</i></font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
The critical thinking measure reports on the capacity to:</font></span></p>
<ul>

<b>The Internal Motivator/Driver Measurement</b></font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<b>The<u> Internal Motivators/Drivers</u> are the second performance multiplier</b>. Based 
upon the Harvard research into human
motivation, it measures the hierarchy and the relative strength of each of the 
seven universal human motivators and how they
uniquely combine to form the “action steps” an individual will WANT to take as 
they translate their critical thinking decisions into
concrete plans and results. It indicates how an individual will overtly or 
covertly want to influence the results that reflect and
support their most influential motivators.</font></span></p>

<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<b>The <u>Behavioral or Communication Style </u>is the third performance multiplier.</b> 
Fostered by 65 years of research into human
interactive dynamics, this multiplier identifies the STYLE someone will use to 
communicate their motivated, critical thinking
decisions to other people. Unlike other DISC tools that measure just the four 
primary behaviors, we measure the 12 integrated
behavioral and communication factors that create the 15 integrated styles that 
plot how the person’s levels of assertiveness,
extroversion, patience and precision uniquely combine to form the overall 
behavioral display the individual will most often use
when sharing and communicating their ideas, beliefs, recommendations and fears 
with others.</font></span></p>

											<p class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Improving customer service skills is easily one of the most profitable investments any business can make. Most customers are willing to pay a premium to have their basic needs met in a timely and efficient manner, and will be pleasantly surprised (and grateful) if they are treated with a little dignity and respect in the bargain. This isn't asking for much, but consistent, responsive, and respectful treatment is surprisingly hard to come by.</font></p>
											<p class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Best-practice organizations do not want customers to be surprised when they get good service. Good is not good enough. Instead, they work hard to ensure that every moment of truth or interface point with a customer creates a positive impression. They achieve this by making sure that each person who serves customers directly and each person on the internal staff who serves the frontline staff is competent in a range of important service skills.</font></p>
											<p class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Which service skills or competencies are most critical in customer service? There are several key themes or broad competencies that seem to be priorities for good service providers. Extensive industry research suggests that there are seven competency areas:</font></p>

											<p class="P39"><span class="T45">
											<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
											Sales success requires that you be 
											highly effective in two areas:<br>
											• Making sales<br>
											• Managing yourself as a sales 
											person<br>
											<br>
											There are a multitude of skills, 
											behaviors, knowledge and attitudes 
											involved in any successful sales 
											career. To know how to improve your 
											own sales performance requires that 
											you look at all of them from time to 
											time. The SalesEffectiveness360 
											(SE360) is your tool for doing a 
											quick self-assessment and for 
											gaining the input of others as well.<br>
											<br>
											This instrument consists of a simple 
											set of 32 questions that guide you 
											in assessing each of the eight 
											primary sales competencies. A sales 
											&quot;competency&quot; is a category of 
											selling proficiency that contains a 
											number of different skill and 
											knowledge components. All eight 
											competencies combine to provide an 
											overview of your selling 
											effectiveness.<br>
											<br>
											Four questions explore each 
											competency from a variety of 
											perspectives. For example: in 
											&quot;preparation&quot; the competency is 
											explored by questions related to 
											Sales Preparation as well as Self 
											Preparation. Sales preparation is 
											addressed externally, outside your 
											own company, and internally, within 
											your company. Self-preparation is 
											addressed from the standpoint of 
											mental preparation and physical 
											preparation. A similar pattern is 
											applied to all eight competencies.<br>
											<br>
											What this means to you is that when 
											you want to increase your sales 
											results, rather than just making 
											more calls or being more persuasive 
											in your presentations, you can 
											identify exactly which of the 32 
											aspects of selling on which to 
											focus. You can be surgical in your 
											focus rather than general. For 
											example: Your limiting factor may be 
											in who you have targeted as 
											prospects or in how you are trying 
											to build credibility with them. 
											Alternatively, it may be in the 
											questions you are asking to 
											determine a prospect&#39;s needs or even 
											in the way you answer questions.<br>
											<br>
											By assessing your sales 
											effectiveness in each area, you will 
											gain an overview that allows you to 
											be a much better self-manager as 
											well as a better sales person.<br>
											<br>
											This SalesEffectiveness360 
											assessment should be done at least 
											three times each year. As you master 
											one area of selling, another area 
											might need your attention. Nobody 
											can attend to all areas all of the 
											time, so occasional check-ups will 
											make a big difference in keeping you 
											in a constant state of improvement.<br>
											<br>
											The Observer component of the SE360 
											is of big value. By seeking an 
											assessment from others, i.e., a 
											sales coach, manager, coworker, 
											friend or key client, you will 
											expand your awareness profoundly. 
											Even though you may know yourself 
											very well, the observations of 
											others about your skills or 
											behaviors can tell you much that 
											would never have occurred to you by 
											using only your own point of view.<br>
											<br>
											Three possible outcomes will be 
											evident in your SE360. When you see 
											the chart displaying your 
											self-assessment side by side with 
											the assessments from your observers, 
											you will see:</font></span></p>
											<p class="P39"><span class="T45">
											<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
											1. Areas on which you agree that 
											things are going fine<br>
											2. Areas on which you agree that 
											improvement is needed<br>
											3. Areas on which you disagree about 
											the need<br>
											<br>
											With the agreement that things are 
											fine, your best path is to continue 
											as is. With the agreement that 
											improvement is needed, your next 
											step is to decide specifically what 
											and how to improve. In addition, 
											with disagreement as to whether 
											improvement is needed or not, you 
											can focus on exploring the situation 
											to see whose view is most accurate.<br>
											<br>
											The major aspects of each sales area 
											are identified for you in this 
											report and are directly related to 
											each of the 32 key areas of sales 
											effectiveness.

		<strong>The Team Building Effectiveness Profile</strong></font><p class="P39"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Success in any organization today rests heavily upon how well you perform as a team. Most people will accept that a champion team will beat a team of individual champions—but how do you create a champion team? Unfortunately, effective teams never just happen; they have to be built. Usually this building process has to be done carefully and has to be customized to the particular needs of each team. Well before any attempt has been made to build the team, it is critical to understand the stages through which a typical team will travel over time. A considerable amount of research has been done on the stages of team growth. This suggests that teams go through four distinct phases—these are:</font></p>
											<ol>
												<li class="P39"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><span class="T2"><strong>Forming:</strong></span><span class="T5"> When any team comes together, or forms, its members continuously explore the boundaries of acceptable behavior within the group. For most teams, this is usually an exciting, if somewhat nervous, time for team members. Emotions such as anticipation, optimism, pride, and hope all mix with emotions such as suspicion, fear, and anxiety—all at the same time. This needs to be slowly but effectively reconciled. </span> <br />
													</font></li>
												<li class="P39"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><span class="T2"><strong>Storming:</strong></span><span class="T5"> Having tested the water several times with their toes, every individual now immerses themselves and tries to “swim.” However, the skills to swim together are not yet fully developed, and the water is deeper and the tide stronger than may have been thought. As a result, a certain amount of concern may set in. The team is often too immature for collaboration, experiences some value lashes and the group often operates less as a team than it did in the “honeymoon” phase.</span> <br />
													</font></li>
												<li class="P39"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><span class="T2"><strong>Norming:</strong></span><span class="T5"> Here the team works out the basic operational ground rules within the group and learns how to swim in the water by learning to cooperate. Although the team maintains much of its critical questioning of the way forward, the new ground rules make this criticism more constructive and positive. At this stage, team collaboration and confidence grows, and the team develops a sense of identity.</span> <br />
													</font></li>
												<li class="P39"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><span class="T2"><strong>Performing:</strong></span><span class="T5"> For those teams that make it, the performance phase is the “pay off” time. Relationships have stabilized, and group problem-solving is now crisp and effective. Strengths and weaknesses of the team are now well understood and cooperation occurs naturally according to needs. The team is now a cohesive, well-oiled unit, capable of achieving high levels of output and growth. </span> </font></li>
												
											</ol>
											<p class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Within these four phases, seven competencies of teambuilding can be derived. These are:</font></p>
											<ol>
												<li class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
												Vision and directional focus 
												(FORMING)</font></li>
												<li class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Alignment of values (FORMING) </font></li>
												<li class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Team role and competency clarity (STORMING) </font></li>
												<li class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Ground rules determination (NORMING) </font></li>
												<li class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Performance appraisal effectiveness (NORMING) </font></li>
												<li class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Team learning and results focus (PERFORMING) </font></li>
												<li class="P17"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Boundary management (PERFORMING) </font></li>
												
												
											</ol>
