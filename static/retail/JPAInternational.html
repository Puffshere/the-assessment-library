An indisputable fact is that people prefer to interact with people they like. 
The ability to create rapport with people is a fundamental skill in sales, 
management, personal relationships, and everyday life. The goal of the <i><b>
DISCstyles</b></i> is to help you create personal chemistry and productive 
relationships. You do not have to change your personality; you simply have to 
understand what drives people and recognize your options for effectively dealing 
with them. <i><b>DISCstyles</b></i> teaches you powerful life skills that will 
serve you well in all your relationships: business, social and family.</font></span></p>

The <i><b>DISCstyles</b></i> online assessment is a resource for individuals and 
organizations desiring to improve performance, increase productivity and to 
positively persuade other people.<br>

prescriptive</b></i> as they are descriptive! In other words, we spend as much 
time teaching you how to improve your own productivity and interpersonal 
interactions as we do describing your natural DISC behavioral style. We realize 
that you are about to invest money and time in our online assessment, so we want 
you to come away with fast, effective learning strategies that get you results 
immediately. The <i><b>DISCstyles</b></i> report has two parts:</font></span></p>
