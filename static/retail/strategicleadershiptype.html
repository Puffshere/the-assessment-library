<p class="P39"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The Strategic Leadership Type Indicator (SLTi) is fast becoming the new standard for a 4-quadrant type supervisory leadership assessment. Trainers appreciate its simplicity combined with ample support materials but without burdensome certification requirements. Supervisors and managers like the emphasis on teaching the appropriate use of four different management styles, particularly the coaching style widely considered the most flexible and motivative supervision technique in wide use today. </font></p>
<p class="P28"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The SLTi assessment is particularly important for supervisors or managers new to the people management role. These professionals experience a wide range of new responsibilities and challenges and have severely limited time to absorb it all and be successful with these new challenges. SLTi offers a prescriptive approach to people management that aligns productivity concerns perfectly with the time consuming realities of supervising and managing people. For example:</font></p>
<ul>
<li class="P28"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><span class="T8">When an employee is clearly both capable and motivated, supervisors learn to use the </span><span class="T4"><strong>delegation strategy</strong></span><span class="T8"> which requires the least direct intervention and monitoring. Supervisors often fall into the time trap of spending too much time on employees who are doing fine without them.</span><br />
</font></li>
<li class="P28"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><span class="T8">If an employee is capable but un-motivated, the supervisor uses the </span><span class="T4"><strong>relate strategy</strong></span><span class="T8"> in order to coax, encourage, and support the employee to help improve their desire to meet their goals more effectively. </span> <br />
</font></li>
<li class="P28"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><span class="T8">When an employee lacks capability as well as motivation, then the supervisor uses the </span><span class="T4"><strong>coach strategy</strong> </span><span class="T8">which requires high relating contact and high levels of teaching/instruction. </span> <br />
</font></li>
<li class="P28"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><span class="T8">With an employee that is new to the job, there is often high motivation but a lack of capability. In this situation, the supervisor should concentrate their time on teaching/instructing since building the relationship will have little impact on motivation. What these employees need is job specific task instruction; the </span><span class="T4"><strong>instruct strategy</strong></span><span class="T8">.</span> </font></li>

</ul>
<p class="P28"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">By using these four strategies appropriately, supervisors manage people both effectively and efficiently. </font></p>
<p class="P28"><font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The SLTi assessment lets supervisors and managers know what their dominant and secondary styles are and how well they deploy the optimal strategy for the employees’ specific needs. Strategic leadership places the new supervisor or manager on a firm foundation from which they can confidently build their own experiences and judgment.</font></p>
