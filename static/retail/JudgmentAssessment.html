It is an irrefutable fact that people have biases and blind spots in their 
processing and judgment ability. The work in neuroscience has demonstrated over 
30+ biases to date, let alone the research that most eyewitnesses can be wrong 
over 75% of the time. It has also been documented that people who have better 
judgment make better decisions and have better social and personal intelligence 
that leads to better relationships and better well-being. If understanding our 
judgment is so fundamental to our decision making, relationships, and personal 
well-being, we should all be working at understanding what potential biases and 
blind spots we have so we can continue to remove them from our everyday lives 
and improve our judgment ability. </font></span></p>

The best way to improve your judgment is to get outside opinions of it and get 
feedback on how accurate it is. It is from gaining new perspectives of awareness 
that we are then consciously able to make improvement. The JUDGMENT<i><b>compass
</b></i>report has been built from a science that allows for an unbiased 
evaluation of your judgment. Unlike most self-report tests, this assessment 
gains understanding about your judgment ability by making you make judgments. 
You will be able to answer the following questions:</font></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
	<font color="#800000"><b>How OBSERVANT are you?</b></font> What is your 
	capacity to naturally pick up on all of information when not directly 
	focusing on it? What selective biases to you have?</font></span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
	<font color="#800000"><b>How OPEN are you?</b></font> How receptive are you 
	to information you receive? Do you tend to see more of the good or the bad? 
	Do you tend to be open and positive or more guarded and skeptical?</font></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
	<font color="#800000"><b>How RESOURCEFUL are you?</b></font> How well can 
	you sort through the information you receive and what you know to set 
	priorities and solve problems? </font></span></p></li>
</ul>

The report is built to not only be descriptive of your judgment strengths by 
indicating your judgment style, but also prescriptive as it will give you 
suggestions for how to reduce potential errors in your judgment that may be 
affecting your performance. If you are about to invest money and time in an 
assessment, this report is certain to provide you with information that will 
give you a new understanding of yourself and strategies for how to make 
improvements. Sometimes the new awareness alone of what influences your judgment 
can make instant changes in performance. </font></span></p>
