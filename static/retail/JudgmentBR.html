<span class="T36">The Judgment Series is a three step report designed to guide 
decision makers through their hiring and selection process from beginning to 
end. Neuroscience research has demonstrated over 75 biases that affect our 
ability to accurately process information and make objective judgments. The 
biases most active during the hiring and selection process have to do with the 
familiarity &quot;circuit&quot; in our brains which triggers associations or experiences 
from our past. The most efficient way to break away from these biases during 
selection— and even insure the performance of new hires— is to use this 
comprehensive system. </span></font></p>
<p class="P39">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<span class="T36"><b>Screening Report <br>
</b>Once a candidate has met the technical, education and experience minimums 
for the job the next step is prioritizing the candidates to go further in the 
selection process. The Screening Report has been designed to flip the paradigm 
of only screening the top talent. While it is important to ensure that all 
candidates meet your minimum qualifications in education and experience, it is 
often difficult to sort through the hundreds of resumes to really understand who 
has the best potential. This report is priced so that a company will want to 
screen everyone that is qualified for a job, to get a better idea of who has the 
greatest potential for success. It is an unbiased way to narrow the field. Too 
often people get jobs because they ‘interview well’, or they had a great resume, 
but in reality they often do not have the personal intelligence to do the job 
well. This this step will insure that you eliminate the potential bad hires and 
increase the number of hires with excellent potential. </span></font></p>
<p class="P39">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<span class="T36"><b>Employability Report<br>
</b>Once a candidate has been validated with our Screening Report, the 
Employability Report is requested. This report requires no additional input from 
the candidate. It&#39;s created using the same results from the Screening Report. </span></font></p>
<p class="P39">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<span class="T36">This report will pinpoint the risk of performance in 21 skill 
and competency areas and provide interviewing questions to help expose any 
potential issues. The information from this report becomes excellent insight 
later during the on-boarding process as well, since it can be used to bring the 
new hire up to speed faster and set realistic performance goals. </span></font></p>
<p class="P39">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<span class="T36">Along with the risk table included with the screening this 
report adds text describing the candidate’s judgment style, their problem 
solving approach, potential strengths and limitations. A graphical 
representation provides a quick overview of this data for quick comparison to 
job requirements. Arguably the most powerful component of this report are the 
targeted interview questions based on the identified risk areas. They help turn 
a biased, potentially subjective interview, into a targeted and objective one. </span></font></p>
<p class="P39">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<span class="T36"><b>Coaching Report<br>
</b>Once you&#39;ve selected the new hire, ensure your investment with this integral 
third phase. Hiring the right person is really just the first step, because 
there will always be gaps to be avoided or strengths to be exploited with each 
new employee. The Coaching report identifies these areas and even potential 
blocks in judgment that can lead to future performance issues. What keeps this 
third phase simple and efficient? The Coaching Report is generated using the 
same results from the initial Screening Report, so there is no additional time 
required of the new employee.</span></font></p>
<p class="P39">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
<span class="T36">In short, The Coaching Report provides incredibly powerful 
information for an organization&#39;s leadership as they chart a development course 
to keep each new hire engaged and productive. Just as importantly, this report 
provides users the necessary strategies to address root problems with employee 
retention-- saving on countless hours and dollars associated with employee 
replacement</span></font></p>
