The purpose of the Job Fitness Report is to show decision makers how they can 
understand the contribution of behavioral fitness to job effectiveness and how 
to use that understanding in interpreting past behavioral job effectiveness as 
well as making better decisions in the future. Understanding behavioral fitness 
offers the practical power of being able to focus their attention and make 
distinctions regarding the strength of the behavioral fitness between a specific 
job and the candidate’s/individuals behavioral style. </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
The Job Fitness Rating is a measure that evaluates the strength of the 
behavioral relationship between a job candidate and the more typical behaviors 
required by a job. The Job Fitness Rating integrates all four (4) dimensions of 
DISC into an overall measure that reflects the strengths of the behavioral 
similarities and/or differences to maximize behavioral effectiveness on the job. </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font size="2" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
The fitness rating is scored on a scale between 1% and 100%. The fitness rating 
represents the strength of the relationship between the candidate’s behavioral 
style and the behavioral requirements of a specific job. The higher the fitness 
rating, the more able the candidate’s natural behavioral style can be applied to 
the task of getting the job done consistent to the job profile.</font></span></p>

<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">A 
behavioral style itself is not so much what the individual thinks or says about 
a person, thing or idea. It’s your observation of how that individual tends to 
act toward people, things and ideas.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">The 
behavioral style fitness rating places a candidate’s fitness compared to a 
specific job benchmark on a (3) three-level rating system. The (3) level rating 
system ranges from limited to excellent to further clarify the fitness rating.
</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
Consider the fitness rating score like a score you are familiar with on a scale 
from 1 to 100. The higher the fitness rating score, the more confident you can 
be that the desired behaviors you want for a specific job will be observable 
with this candidate/individual. The lower the fitness rating, the more confident 
you can be that the desired behaviors you want for a specific job will not be 
observable with the candidate/individual.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">A 
fitness rating of .75% means that the candidate and the job profile share .75% 
of the target behaviors whereas 25% of the behavioral style is different. To 
understand which behaviors are similar or different, look at the 12 factors and 
four factor details on page 4 of the sample report.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">An 
Excellent Fitness Ratings means the employee/candidate will spend less energy 
thinking about how to adapt their behaviors to the behaviors required of the 
targeted job role and allow their more natural behaviors to create results.
</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">A 
Good Fitness Rating means the employee/candidate will need to be reminded from 
time to time of their behavioral effectiveness in their role. </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">A 
Stretch Fitness Rating means the employee/candidate will need to facilitate 
their behavioral effectiveness through consistent timely feedback and 
structures. The lack of quality feedback regarding an individual’s behavioral 
distance from a specific job requirement has the potential of creating a false 
illusion that their behaviors are effective which reinforces their current 
behavior.</font></span></p>

to analyze and compare individuals and benchmarks, you start by using 
individuals with completed DISC assessments. You also create your benchmarks via 
the DISC Fitness Benchmark creation tool located in your admin. </font></b></i>
</p>
<p class="P39"><font face="Arial" size="2">The purpose of this system is to 
allow you to compare <b>benchmarks to individuals</b> (end users). You can also 
compare <b>end users to end users</b>. You can choose as many benchmarks or end 
users as desired. The results will display in a grid showing all the percentage 
matches. You can then click on each percentage(%) to gain a more detailed 
analysis along with the ability to generate a full PDF Fitness report. You are 
not limited to selecting benchmarks and individuals. You can also selection ONLY 
individuals or benchmarks. This would allow you to compare people to people and 
vice versa. </font>
