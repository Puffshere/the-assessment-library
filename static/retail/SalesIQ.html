<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">Most 
people know the measure of a salesperson’s success is their ability to make new 
sales. However, how can a sales manager or organization predict a sales 
professional’s current skill level? Likewise, how can sales professionals see 
through the opaque lens of self-bias and identify their own areas of improvement 
while finding the practical solutions for correcting them? </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">Like 
any profession, selling has a body of knowledge related to successful execution. 
There are a multitude of skills, behaviors, knowledge and attitudes involved in 
any successful sales career. To know how to improve your own sales performance 
requires that you look at all of them from time to time. The Sales IQ Plus 
assessment offers such an objective analysis and essentially answers the 
question, “Can this person sell?” </font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
Developed jointly by best-selling authors Jeffrey Gitomer (The Sales Bible), Jim 
Cathcart (Relationship Selling) and Dr. Tony Alessandra (The Platinum Rule for 
DISC Sales Mastery), the Sales IQ Plus measures a sales professional’s 
understanding of the strategies required to sell successfully in any sales 
environment.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">This 
assessment takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and consists of 48 
questions that guide you in assessing each of the eight primary sales 
competencies, along with some vital selling traits. A sales &quot;competency&quot; is a 
category of selling proficiency that contains a number of different skill and 
knowledge components. All eight competencies combine to provide an overview of 
your current selling effectiveness.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39">
<span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">Each 
of the eight primary competencies is explored from a variety of perspectives:</font></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
	<b>Preparing</b> for the sale and preparing yourself.. You can be well 
	prepared with information and sales tools but if you are not in the 
	appropriate frame of mind, or if you do not appear professional to the 
	buyer, you might not get the sale.</font></span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
	<b>Targeting</b> explores the markets or groups you may target as 
	prospective buyers. Then we focus on the individuals with whom you will make 
	contact. This includes the sales strategies and tactics you select for each 
	target market. Poor targeting with great selling skills would result in 
	limited success because you would be selling to the wrong people.</font></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
	<b>Connecting</b> is the initial sales contact step where you must appeal to 
	people intellectually so that they see you as a credible resource and 
	emotionally so that they trust you as a person. Without either, you are 
	inhibited from learning enough about them to solve their problems and make a 
	sale.</font></span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
	<b>Assessing</b> needs and wants uncovers what to sell and how to sell it 
	primarily through probing and listening. As they say, “In sales as in 
	medicine, prescription before diagnosis is malpractice.”</font></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
	<b>Solving</b> the buyer’s problem, or filling their need, is where most of 
	the sales attention has been placed in the past. This is the part where you 
	present your solutions, tell your stories, demonstrate your product or 
	describe the outcomes that buying will produce. At its lowest level, this is 
	a sales pitch. At its highest level, this is a dialogue where you prove 
	there is great value to them in buying from you.</font></span></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
	<b>Confirming</b> is the sales phase where you gain the prospect’s 
	commitment to buy. Confirming is achieved only once you have shown the 
	ability to solve the prospect’s problem. Historically, this has been known 
	as “closing” the sale, but the truth is that it is not an end, but the 
	beginning. It is at this point that the sales professional begins serving 
	the customer and they, in turn, begin paying for the value they receive.</font></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
	<b>Assuring</b> clients that the value promised will be received is critical 
	to customer retention. This is where relationships are built and customer 
	loyalty is to be given (by you) more than expected (from them).</font></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
	<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
	<b>Managing</b> is the final phase of the sales cycle where you manage sales 
	and accounts and self manage yourself. Ultimately, we are all our own ‘sales 
	manager’. This is the phase of selling where you must get yourself to do 
	what needs to be done even when you do not feel like doing it.</font></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">By 
assessing your sales effectiveness in each of the eight areas, you will gain an 
overview that allows you to be a much more effective self manager and 
consistently successful sales professional.</font></span></p>
<p class="P39"><span class="T36">
<font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif" size="2">
Note: Each situation was developed and validated by sales professionals to 
reflect real sales strategies used by today’s sales force. </font></span></p>
