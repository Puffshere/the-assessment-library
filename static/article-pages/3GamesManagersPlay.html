								<strong>3 GAMES MANAGERS PLAY THAT RESULT IN HIRING LOSERS</strong></font>

						DID YOU EVER HIRE A &quot;SQUARE PEG FOR A ROUND HOLE?&quot;ù</strong></font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">You can use pre-employment tests, certain astute insights, less laziness plus a shocking realization about betting to help you avoid a huge hiring mistake 
						&quot;ì avoid hiring &quot;òa square peg for a round hole.'  </font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><br>
								<strong>I'VE RECEIVED A &quot;DEJA VU&quot;ù PHONE CALL HUNDREDS OF TIMES</strong></font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">You will benefit from hearing a phone call I received hundreds of times from managers at a big variety of companies.  I call it a deja 
						vu phone call, because I have gotten the same phone call 
						so many times that, as Yogi Berra quipped, &quot;It's like deja† vu all over 
						again.&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
						In this phone call I receive, a manager who uses my 
						pre-employment tests calls me, and says, &quot;I want to hire an applicant, but the applicant got horrible scores on your pre-employment tests.  But, I loved the applicant in the interview.  What should I 
						do?&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
						I always respond, &quot;Well, that's up to you.&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
						To which the manager always asks me, &quot;O.K. but, Dr. Mercer, what should I 
						do?&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">
						Invariably, the problem boils down to this: A company 
						using the pre-employment tests has customized &quot;Benchmark 
						Scores.&quot;ù  Those are scores its superstars or best employees typically earn on the tests.  To help hire the best, the company obviously should prefer applicants who get pre-employment test scores similar to its best 
						employees' &quot;Benchmark&quot;ù test scores.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">However, the manager making the 
						&quot;Deja Vu&quot;ù phone call has an applicant who scored very different than the company's superstars' 
						&quot;Benchmark&quot;ù test scores.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">So, I explain, 
						&quot;The pre-employment test and its benchmark scores are the only customized and accurate prediction method you use.  In contrast, interviews and reference checks are subjective, and typically rather inaccurate.  The benchmark scores on the pre-employment tests are customized to tell you if an applicant has key qualities similar to your company's best employees in each job.&quot;ù  </font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Then, I continue, 
						&quot;So, you want to hire applicants who get test scores similar to your superstar employees, plus also do well in all other prediction methods, such as interviews, reference and background checks, and realistic job observations.&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Suddenly, the truth comes out.  The manager played hiring 
						&quot;ògames' could have resulted in a whopper mistake:  Hiring a 
						&quot;òsquare peg for a round hole,' specifically, hiring a lousy applicant. </font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Here are three games managers play 
						&quot;ì that can result is the blunder of &quot;òhiring a square peg for a round hole.&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><br>
								<strong>GAME #1 = SEMI-PSEUDO-RELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE</strong></font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The manager hopes 
						&quot;ì or hallucinates &quot;ì the applicant's seemingly relevant work experience is transferable to success in the manager's company.  This often is an incorrect assumption.  Just because an applicant did similar work does not mean the applicant will be productive in the new job.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><br>
								<strong>GAME #2 = FALLING IN LOVE &quot;ì WITH THE APPLICANT</strong></font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">This is a shockingly common mistake managers make.  Why?  First, research proves most managers do not know how to interview applicants nor make correct judgments based on interviews.  Second, job hunters know interviewing tricks that knock-your-socks-off.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Here are three actions a well-rehearsed applicant uses to make a manager 
						&quot;òfall in love' with him or her.  The applicant uses charm tricks of</font></p>
						<ul>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">1.  entering room with big smile, looks manager in eye, and gives nice handshake<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">2.  complimenting the manager's office or a photo or momen to in the manager's office<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">3.  making the manager laugh or smile in the first 120 seconds</font>
						</ul>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">After 
						&quot;òfalling in love' with and hiring the super-charmer, a manager frequently feels foolish, like lyrics of Dierk Smedley's song: 
						&quot;I knew what I was feeling.  But, what was I thinking?&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><br>
								<strong>GAME #3 = TOO LAZY &quot;ì TO FIND A BETTER APPLICANT</strong></font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">After a manager admits to being seduced by semi-pseudo-relevant work experience and 
						&quot;òfalling in love' with a charming applicant, then the truth comes out:  The manager feels too lazy to find more applicants.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">But here is the bottom line:  A manager will spend less time finding a superb applicant than the manager wastes while managing an average or below-average applicant 
						&quot;ì and applicant who never should have been hired.  Plus, a productive employee proves vastly more profitable.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">So, I always assure the manager by saying, 
						&quot;I know it's a hassle to find more applicants, but I'm sure you can find applicants who will turn into top-notch employees.&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><br>
								<strong><em>SHOCKING REALIZATION =</em> <br>
									EACH TIME YOU HIRE SOMEONE, YOU ARE BETTING YOUR JOB &amp; COMPANY</strong></font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">After discussing Games 1, 2 and 3, I say this to the hiring manager to convince them it is worthwhile to find better applicants:  
						&quot;Hiring is like betting.  Every time you hire a person you are betting your job, career, and company.  Do you feel confident betting on an applicant whose pre-employment test scores were different than benchmark test scores of your best employees?&quot;ù</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">There always is silence on the phone.  Then, the manager slowly speaks up and says, 
						&quot;You're right &quot;ì I am betting my career and the company each time I hire someone.  Now, I realize I need to find a better applicant.  It's worth my time and energy.&quot;ù</font></p>

						<ol>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Pre-employment tests

									 are the most accurate way to predict if an applicant may succeed in your company.  <br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Don't bet against test results comparing applicant to your company's customized benchmarks.<br>

							&quot;ì when you fail to hire the best.<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Prefer applicants who get high ratings on all prediction methods 
							&quot;ì tests, interviews, and more.<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Hiring is betting.  <br>

						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong></font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Bet on job applicants who (a) get scores like your best employees' scores on pre-employment tests, and also (b) rate well on all other prediction methods you use.  That makes a good bet for your job, career, and company.  </font></p>
