			 You can't claim leadership. You earn it. No matter where your commitment 
takes you, or what your leadership accomplishes, it is exciting to know that 
you are always in the process of earning your leadership stripes by: <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								· Treating people as if today is the only day you have to help them reach 
their full potential. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								· Teaching the benefits of setting a good example to the lowest level people 
in your organization. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								· Knowing that if you take very good care of today, tomorrow will take care of 
itself. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								· Accepting full responsibility and accountability for your thoughts and 
actions. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								· Taking time each day to be alone, to communicate with your God, to think about 
your mission in life, and how you are going to make a difference. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								When you have the courage to be a leader continually committed to 
earning 
your stripes, your potential is endless.
