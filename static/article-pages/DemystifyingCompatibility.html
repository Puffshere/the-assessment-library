			Compatibility, or the lack of it, is not such a mystery.  Both rapport and tension are rather 
predictable, once you know what to look for.  Here's the basic principle:  In social 
situations, like behavioral styles attract.  People with similar interests and habits are 
drawn to one another as friends and acquaintances. There's a sense of satisfaction in 
knowing you're among people who prize what you prize, enjoy what you enjoy, play by 
roughly the same rules as you do. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								If you're a Relater or Thinker, you're a more structured person who's not fond of surprises.  
Thus, you find stable, predictable relationships more satisfying.  You get your needs met 
by being around those who won't embarrass you by, say, showing up in a magenta sports 
coat, or asking deeply personal questions upon first meeting you. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Or maybe you're a faster-paced, more outgoing person, a Director or Socializer who 
thinks life's too short to worry about whether your tires are properly inflated, or your 
socks match your tie.  Who the heck's going to know or care 100 years from now, right? 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>The Big Ten--And How They Perform Socially  </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								So what happens when these sometimes-contradictory types get together? Well, the four 
basic behavioral styles mix and match into ten combinations.  Behavioral science research 
shows clearly which combinations--prior to use of The Platinum Rule--mesh or clash 
naturally. (Please see highlighted box for definition of The Platinum Rule.) 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								For starters, people with similar tendencies are most compatible with one another 
socially.  That's because those with common interests, habits, and approaches help 
reinforce each other's self-esteem. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								So it won't surprise you to learn that the most naturally compatible combinations in social 
situations are: 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Thinker-Thinker  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Relater-Relater  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Socializer-Socializer
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Where, you ask, are the Directors?  Well, they also tend to flock to one another--at least 
for a while.  But they possess such a strong competitiveness that even the Director- 
Director relationship isn't quite as naturally harmonious as the others. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								That pairing does, however, show up under the moderately compatible category: 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Director  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Relater-Thinker  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Socializer  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Socializer-Relater 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Compatibility doesn't come quite as naturally in these cases.  But with effort, progress is 
possible and, in fact, success in working with less compatible individuals can be an 
esteem builder in each case. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Directors and Socializers share an outward focus and often-similar interests.  Relaters and 
Thinkers, on the other hand, are both inward-oriented and may like the same kinds of 
activities. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Both Socializers and Relaters aspire to be in a supportive relationship.  Usually, though, 
it's the Relater who's in the giving role and the Socializer who's the receiver. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Meanwhile, the fast-paced, extroverted Directors and Socializers commonly find it hard 
to develop rapport with the easygoing, quieter Relaters and Thinkers, who are less 
decisive and enthusiastic.  And the Relaters and Thinkers, in turn, find the Directors less 
desirable because they're too pushy, too loud, and often demand too much of them. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Therefore, of all ten combinations, these three pairs are often the least naturally 
compatible socially: 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Relater <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Socializer-Thinker  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Thinker 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								To the Director, who just wants to get things done, and to the Socializer, who just wants 
to have fun, the cautious Thinker and steady Relaters can be drags.  While Relaters often 
resign themselves to tolerate the forwardness of Directors and Socializers, the Thinker 
frequently just prefers to be alone. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								What's more, even when relaxing, the Thinker wants to do all things right.  Whether it's 
just grilling hot dogs, chatting about politics, or setting up the croquet wickets, the 
Thinker sets standards and judges himself and others by how they meet them.  The 
Thinker, in the eyes of the Director or Socializer, is not living as much as he is just 
serving time.  By and large, never the twain shall meet--at least unless and until The 
Platinum Rule is practiced. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								On the positive side, though, there is a fascination factor in these three pairings, and 
bridges can be built. Given positive energy, the natural differences can fuel attraction, 
particularly when one style sees what it can learn from another.  A Director, for example, 
may see how he can become more patient and responsive to others by taking a cue from a 
Relater.  A Relater, meanwhile, may be able to draw on the Director's strengths for taking 
charge and accepting risk. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Similarly, a sensitive Socializer can see how she can learn discretion from the Thinker, 
and the Thinker perceives that she can become more relaxed and sociable by being 
around the Socializer. 
  
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B> It's Different Task-Wise </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								When it comes to tasks--whether it's doing a project at work, purchasing a family car, or 
just balancing the checkbook--the dynamics differ dramatically.   Here, the "likes" who 
are drawn to one another socially don't necessarily attract as much as they compete or 
even conflict. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Now their similarities can get in the way because they have the same needs.  After all, to 
complete a task, one must have resources, rewards, time, space, and attention. But there 
are only so many of those to go around. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								So when those needs aren't met, tension and conflict can result.  When one partner feels a 
need to "win," for instance, the other one may sense he or she's been shortchanged.   The 
frequent outcome: resentment. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								But, before getting into which pairs clash, let's look at the most naturally compatible 
combinations task wise: 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Thinker-Relater <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Relater <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Socializer-Relater <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								See a pattern here?  You bet!  The Relater gets along with everybody in a task situation.  
He or she's the universal antidote for disharmony.  It's the Relaters' most distinctive trait.  
They're supportive workers who exert a calming, stabilizing influence.  Naturally 
interested in others and in making a contribution, they enjoy being productive partners.  
No wonder they're everybody's favorite.   
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								The moderately compatible combinations, as far as working on tasks together, are: 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								
Thinker-Thinker<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Relater-Relater <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Socializer-Thinker <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Thinkers loom large in this second grouping.  While not as easygoing as Relaters, they are 
sensitive to others' feelings and have a passion for excellence that others usually 
recognize. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Interestingly, Thinkers figure in many of the least compatible combinations socially, but 
among the highest in tasks.  This suggests that others appreciate the quality and 
thoroughness of their work, even if the Thinkers aren't always viewed as being a lot of 
laughs.  Perhaps the most difficult hurdles socially are posed by the Director-Thinker relationship.  
For it to work, both must yield their personal control needs, with the Director deciding to 
give the type of space the Thinker needs, and the Thinker learning to be much more direct 
and open about his concerns with the Director. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Last come those combinations that are least compatible because they tend to see one 
another as competitors: 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Director <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Thinker <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Socializer <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Socializer-Socializer <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Director-Director combinations work fairly well socially but when it comes to tasks, a 
Director's competitive nature and need for control can stymie cooperation, especially with 
like-minded Directors. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								As for the Director-Thinker, there's a fundamental clash in the Director's need for speed 
and control versus the Thinker's penchant for being slower paced and systematic. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Notice that while the Socializer-Socializer pair was ranked as among the most socially 
compatible, now they are likely to be the least productive as far as working together on 
tasks.  That's because neither is motivated to deal with task details.   
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Similarly, Directors and Socializers also have moderately high social rapport but 
plummet to the lowest rungs of compatibility when tasks are involved.  That's because 
they both tend to want to delegate. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								But don't give up yet on those whose personal style may not be a perfect fit with the 
situation.  With some effort at understanding and applying The Platinum Rule, you can 
adapt your compatibility so that you can work successfully with anyone.
