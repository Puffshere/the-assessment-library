			How many times have you read an email, letter, report, or proposal that began, "he 
purpose of this document is to 'blah, blah, blah'?"   And the writer of the document 
goes on for another sentence or paragraph, promising what he or she is GOING to tell 
you.  A purpose statement is like a prose table of contents; it merely promises to tell 
readers something later - if the readers keep forging ahead.  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								I'd prefer the writer just tell me rather than promise to tell me. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								To grab your reader's attention, open with a message statement rather than a purpose 
statement.  A message statement informs.  It summarizes the key points of the entire 
document.   <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Purpose: This email is in response to your request to provide further information 
about the NTA convention expenses. <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Message: I have reviewed the trade-show opportunities at the NTA convention May 
9-11 and estimate our total exhibit and travel expenses to be 
approximately $15,500. <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Purpose: The purpose of this report is to outline some of our plans in the marketing 
efforts to be directed by John Lynover. <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Message: The Model 409TZ marketing efforts to be directed by John Lynover 
include a direct-mail campaign, free public seminars, and a rebate coupon 
packaged with the product. We've outlined below .... <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Don't just "set the stage" for your message.  Pull the curtain. 
<BR>
