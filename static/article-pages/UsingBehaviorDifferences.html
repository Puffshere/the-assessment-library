						&quot;Team Building That Works<br>
						By Tony Alessandra, PhD</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						Ever wondered why so many of the teams you have 
						experienced seem to do everything but work? It has 
						everything to do with how a team is built. Unfortunately 
						the activity of assembling a team usually looks more 
						like this. &quot;Round up the usual suspects,&quot; the gendarme 
						ordered in the famous line from the movie &quot;Casablanca.&quot; 
						And frequently that's how executives think when they 
						create teams, committees, or task forces.</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						The boss says or thinks something like: &quot;Let's appoint 
						anyone who might know something about this issue.&quot; Or 
						even more likely: &quot;Grab anybody who's got a stake in 
						this thing.&quot;</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						Organizations, of course, love such groups because when 
						they work, they can improve coordination, help employees 
						feel more involved, and maybe even spur innovation. But 
						when they flop--or, more commonly, just lapse into 
						mediocrity--they can drain an organization of its 
						vitality and leave a legacy of posturing, power 
						struggles, and misunderstandings.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Designing a Group<br>
						</b><br>
						We naively assume any group can automatically be a team. 
						But, actually, one of the biggest single reasons that 
						teams misfire is that personality differences are 
						ignored. In short, who's selected for the team will very 
						likely affect the outcome. So, for best results, we 
						can’t just order an off-the-rack model—we’ve got to 
						design one that'll best do the job.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						If, when you create a team, you employ knowledge of the 
						four personality types, or behavioral styles (see 
						sidebar), you greatly improve its chances for success. 
						You need to take into account that there are natural 
						allies and antagonists among the styles and also that 
						each style functions best at a different phase in the 
						life cycle of a team.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						For example, Socializers often see Thinkers as 
						overly-analytical fuss-budgets. Directors might sooner 
						die than turn into dull plodders like the Relaters. 
						Thinkers, while often drawn to Relaters, have difficulty 
						understanding the Socializer’s lack of focus or the 
						Director’s impatience.And Relaters only wish everyone 
						was as amiable as they.</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						So while the potential for conflict is always there, it 
						needn’t become the reality. In creating a team, think 
						about whom you are putting on it and monitor how they 
						function during the group’s evolution. That way you’ll 
						not only make the best possible use of the strengths of 
						each team member, you can help create a whole that's 
						much larger than the sum of the parts. <br>
						<br>
						<b>The Natural Cycle of Groups</b> <br>
						<br>
						Work groups typically follow a cycle, just like the 
						organizations which spawn them. They face predictable 
						obstacles, rise to the occasion or fail, and as a 
						result, either evolve or deteriorate. At every stage in 
						that cycle, each of the various behavioral styles can be 
						a help or a hindrance.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Phase One: FINDING FOCUS</b><br>
						<br>
						Any new group at first gropes to find its focus. Members 
						of the group ask, or at least think: Is this going to be 
						worth the effort? Is this going to be a useful team that 
						can get things done? Or is it just another group holding 
						yet more meetings aimed at producing another report that 
						nobody reads?














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						In addition, each member at this point is seeking to 
						define his or her role. They silently ask: &quot;Do I fit in 
						here, or am I an outsider?&quot; &quot;Am I going to be an 
						important member of this group with real input, or am I 
						just here for appearances?&quot; &quot;Is this going to waste my 
						time?&quot;</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						Thinkers and Directors can be especially helpful during 
						this first phase. They are both skilled at getting to 
						the heart of matters, though in different ways.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						If the challenges the group faces are intellectually 
						complex, the Thinker will be in his element. Because 
						they're so good at reasoned analysis on tasks, Thinkers 
						they can help clarify the mission and give the team 
						focus.</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						Similarly, if the main hurdle the group faces is more of 
						a conflict—say, a history of discord among members 
						and/or a split over its goals—a Director likely will 
						shine. In fact, the group may be yearning for just a 
						strong leader who can tell the warring members to quit 
						butting heads and either commit, or leave. That's a 
						situation ready-made for the Director.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						In either case, the Thinker or Director may be able to 
						get the group to psychologically buy into the idea of 
						moving forward together, to convince the team that 
						there's a &quot;plan&quot; and progress will be possible.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Phase Two: FACING THE REALITIES<br>
						</b><br>
						While a tough-minded Thinker or Director may get the 
						group going, this stormy second stage often cries out 
						for the buoyant optimism of the Socializers. Their 
						friendly, informal brand of leadership can send out a 
						strong, clear signal that this group can work together 
						and make things better for everybody.</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						A people-oriented approach is needed at this stage 
						because not just the team's internal dynamics but also 
						external issues must be addressed here. It's at this 
						point that reality often intrudes. The group may begin 
						to see how difficult its task really is, how little time 
						and resources are available, and how members may need to 
						settle for a half a loaf rather than a stunning 
						breakthrough.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						All these factors can breed frustration, confusion, and 
						disillusionment. This is when it’ll be decided if the 
						group tackles the real issues in meaningful ways, or 
						gets mired in its own internal power struggle. That’s 
						why Socializers, who are good at smoothing over rough 
						edges and encouraging all to share their thoughts and 
						feelings, can be a key here.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						Many groups, of course, never transcend this 
						them-versus-us mindset. They’re continuing to silently 
						debate: “Who's the ‘top dog?’&quot; “Who stands to gain the 
						most and who'll likely come up the loser?” Such a team 
						isn’t likely to accomplish much. Instead, members will 
						continuously collide with one another, limiting 
						themselves as a team and as individuals.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						But if the Socializer, with his or her upbeat attitude 
						and people skills, can get the members to quit keeping 
						score, they may yet learn to work together. If the 
						Socializer can convince them that who’s in charge is 
						less important than who has what know-how and attitudes, 
						the group will have entered the next phase.</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt; font-weight:700">
						Phase Three: COMING TOGETHER</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						Cooperation and collaboration become increasingly 
						apparent, and it's now that Relaters can give the group 
						a boost. Because they are especially good at coalescing 
						differing views, the Relaters help meld individual 
						differences into group progress.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						By opening their hearts and heads to one another, the 
						Relaters, or others with Relater-like behavior, can 
						blend the discordant elements into more of a single 
						melody. The team begins to narrow the gap between what 
						it earlier said it wanted to do and what it's actually 
						doing. There's been a shift of identity, and it's become 
						a true team because members who previously thought in 
						terms of &quot;me,&quot; begin thinking &quot;we.&quot;














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt; font-weight:700">
						Phase Four: REACHING FOR STARDOM</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						The final stage is more the exception than the rule. 
						But, when reached, it means a team really is performing 
						at its best and highest use; that it's functioning as a 
						whole, not just as a collection of individuals.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						Its members enjoy being part of the team and express 
						that fact. They've learned how to work together. Morale 
						is high. The group continually produces quality and 
						quantity output and is effectively self-managing.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						In the previous three stages, Director-type behavior 
						might have been called for on key decisions. But at this 
						stage, a hands-on, controlling style isn't needed. In 
						fact, once a group has this momentum, such a 
						strong-handed style can be counterproductive and could 
						even torpedo the group's progress. Instead, the team's 
						decisions flow naturally from its deliberations. 
						Differences among its members become a source of 
						strength, not dispute.</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt; font-weight:700">
						Differences, Not Deficiencies</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						Love'em or hate'em, work groups are here to stay. (Some 
						estimates are that as much as 50% to 80% of a manager's 
						time, for example, is spent with groups.) But while they 
						can be high-performance vehicles, they're can also be 
						high-maintenance, especially in the early stages. Both 
						the team's creator and its members need to carefully 
						watch the process. Only a team that fully understands 
						and savors its members' styles is likely to be genuinely 
						productive.














			</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						If members were chosen carefully and if they practice 
						adaptability, the advantages of stylistic diversity can 
						quickly outweigh the group's liabilities. Remember: 
						We're talking about personality differences here, not 
						deficiencies.</FONT></P>
						<P style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px;">
						<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000" STYLE="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 13pt;">
						So, in the final analysis, working with groups all comes 
						down to suspending judgment, empathizing, and trying to 
						play to people's strengths. The result, despite our 
						differences, can be a wonderful synergy.
