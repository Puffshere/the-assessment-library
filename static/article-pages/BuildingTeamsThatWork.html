			 "Round up the usual suspects," the gendarme ordered in the famous line from 
the movie "Casablanca." And frequently that's how executives think when they create 
teams, committees, or task forces.
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								The boss says or thinks something like: "Let's appoint anyone who might know 
something about this issue." Or even more likely: "Grab anybody who's got a stake in 
this thing." 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Organizations, of course, love such groups because when they work, they can 
improve coordination, help employees feel more involved, and maybe even spur 
innovation. But when they flop--or, more commonly, just lapse into mediocrity--they can 
drain an organization of its vitality and leave a legacy of posturing, power struggles, and 
misunderstandings. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Designing a Group </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								We naively assume any group can automatically be a team. But, actually, one of 
the biggest single reasons that teams misfire is that personality differences are ignored. 
In short, who's selected for the team will very likely affect the outcome. So, for best 
results, we can't just order an off-the-rack model-we've got to design one that'll best 
do the job.  
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								If, when you create a team, you employ knowledge of the four personality types, 
or behavioral styles (see sidebar), you greatly improve its chances for success. You 
need to take into account that there are natural allies and antagonists among the styles 
and also that each style functions best at a different phase in the life cycle of a team.  
For example, SOCIALIZERS often see THINKERS as overly-analytical fuss- 
budgets. DIRECTORS might sooner die than turn into dull plodders like the 
RELATERS. THINKERS, while often drawn to RELATERS, have difficulty 
understanding the SOCIALIZER's lack of focus or the DIRECTOR's impatience. And 
RELATERS only wish everyone was as amiable as they.
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								So while the potential for conflict is always there, it needn't become the reality. In 
creating a team, think about who you are putting on it and monitor how they function 
during the group's evolution. That way you'll not only make the best possible use of the 
strengths of each team member, you can help create a whole that's much larger than 
the sum of the parts.  
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>The Natural Cycle of Groups </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Work groups typically follow a cycle, just like the organizations which spawn 
them. They face predictable obstacles, rise to the occasion or fail, and as a result, 
either evolve or deteriorate. At every stage in that cycle, each of the various behavioral 
styles can be a help or a hindrance. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Phase One: FINDING FOCUS </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Any new group at first gropes to find its focus. Members of the group ask, or at 
least think: Is this going to be worth the effort? Is this going to be a useful team that can get things done? Or is it just another group holding yet more meetings aimed at 
producing another report that nobody reads? 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								In addition, each member at this point is seeking to define his or her role. They 
silently ask: "Do I fit in here, or am I an outsider?"  "Am I going to be an important 
member of this group with real input, or am I just here for appearances?" "Is this going 
to waste my time?" 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								THINKERS and DIRECTORS can be especially helpful during this first phase. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								They are both skilled at getting to the heart of matters, though in different ways.  
If the challenges the group faces are intellectually complex, the THINKER will be 
in his element. Because they're so good at reasoned analysis on tasks, THINKERS 
they can help clarify the mission and give the team focus. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Similarly, if the main hurdle the group faces is more of a conflict-say, a history 
of discord among members and/or a split over its goals-a DIRECTOR likely will shine. 
In fact, the group may be yearning for just a strong leader who can tell the warring 
members to quit butting heads and either commit, or leave. That's a situation ready- 
made for the DIRECTOR.  
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								In either case, the THINKER or DIRECTOR may be able to get the group to 
psychologically buy into the idea of moving forward together, to convince the team that 
there's a "plan" and progress will be possible. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Phase Two: FACING THE REALITIES </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								While a tough-minded THINKER or DIRECTOR may get the group going, this 
stormy second stage often cries out for the buoyant optimism of the SOCIALIZERS. 
Their friendly, informal brand of leadership can send out a strong, clear signal that this 
group can work together and make things better for everybody. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								A people-oriented approach is needed at this stage because not just the team's 
internal dynamics but also external issues must be addressed here. It's at this point that 
reality often intrudes. The group may begin to see how difficult its task really is, how 
little time and resources are available, and how members may need to settle for a half a 
loaf rather than a stunning breakthrough.
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								All these factors can breed frustration, confusion, and disillusionment. This is 
when it'll be decided if the group tackles the real issues in meaningful ways, or gets 
mired in its own internal power struggle. That's why SOCIALIZERS, who are good at 
smoothing over rough edges and encouraging all to share their thoughts and feelings, 
can be a key here.
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Many groups, of course, never transcend this them-versus-us mindset. They're 
continue to silently debate: "Who's the 'top dog?'" "Who stands to gain the most and 
who'll likely come up the loser?" Such a team isn't likely to accomplish much. Instead, 
members will continuously collide with one another, limiting themselves as a team and 
as individuals.
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								But if the SOCIALIZER, with his or her upbeat attitude and people skills, can get 
the members to quit keeping score, they may yet learn to work together. If the 
SOCIALIZER can convince them that who's in charge is less important than who has 
what know-how and attitudes, the group will have entered the next phase. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B> Phase Three: COMING TOGETHER </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Cooperation and collaboration become increasingly apparent, and it's now that 
RELATERS can give the group a boost. Because they are especially good at 
coalescing differing views, the RELATERS help meld individual differences into group 
progress. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								By opening their hearts and heads to one another, the RELATERS, or others 
with RELATER-like behavior, can blend the discordant elements into more of a single 
melody. The team begins to narrow the gap between what it earlier said it wanted to do 
and what it's actually doing. There's been a shift of identity, and it's become a true team 
because members who previously thought in terms of "me," begin thinking "we."   
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Phase Four: REACHING FOR STARDOM </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								The final stage is more the exception than the rule. But, when reached, it means 
a team really is performing at its best and highest use, that it's functioning as a whole, 
not just as a collection of individuals.  
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Its members enjoy being part of the team and express that fact. They've learned 
how to work together. Morale is high. The group continually produces quality and 
quantity output and is effectively self-managing.  
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								In the previous three stages, DIRECTOR-type behavior might have been called 
for on key decisions. But at this stage, a hands-on, controlling style isn't needed. In fact, 
once a group has this momentum, such a strong-handed style can be 
counterproductive and could even torpedo the group's progress. Instead, the team's 
decisions flow naturally from its deliberations. Differences among its members become 
a source of strength, not dispute. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Differences, Not Deficiencies </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Love'em or hate'em, work groups are here to stay. (Some estimates are that as 
much as 50% to 80% of a manager's time, for example, is spent with groups.) But while  
they can be high-performance vehicles, they're can also be high-maintenance, 
especially in the early stages. Both the team's creator and its members need to 
carefully watch the process. Only a team that fully understands and savors its 
members' styles is likely to be genuinely productive. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								If members were chosen carefully and if they practice adaptability, the 
advantages of stylistic diversity can quickly outweigh the group's liabilities. Remember: 
We're talking about personality differences here, not deficiencies. 
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								So, in the final analysis, working with groups all comes down to suspending 
judgment, empathizing, and trying to play to people's strengths. The result, despite our 
differences, can be a wonderful synergy.
