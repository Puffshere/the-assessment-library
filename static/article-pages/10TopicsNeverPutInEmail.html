Ask any ten people if they know of someone who has been terminated or 
an organization that has been hauled into court over an email, and at least 
one can cite person and case.  The story usually has an unhappy ending. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Here are the No-Nos: 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
1) Negative comments about upper management  (Even if "deleted," these emails 
can be retrieved.  Often such remarks accidentally get passed on.  After four replies 
on an ongoing saga, someone forgets your sarcastic line buried at the bottom and 
forwards the email to another colleague to answer a different question.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
2) Criticism regarding peer or staff performance issues  (Written comments cause 
employees to brood.  They seem more official than spoken words.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
3) Bonuses or salary issues (If positive plans fail to materialize, the writing seems like 
"proof" that they are deserved.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
4) Racial or gender slurs (Surely not in this decade) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
5) Product or service liabilities  (Opponents can subpoena your emails as evidence 
that you were aware of problems and ignored warnings.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
6) Competitor untruths  (See you in court.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
7) Gossip about colleagues  (Even the most innocent "news" can strike people the 
wrong way  If they want it told, they'll tell it.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
8) Sloppy writing  (Clear writing reflects clear thinking. The opposite is also true.  Your 
image may depend on daily informal email more than on formal documents.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
9) Humor - particularly sarcasm and tongue-in-cheek  (What comes across well 
with proper inflection, a smile, a goofy expression, and a slap on the back frequently 
falls flat on the screen.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
10) Anything about your personal life you'd be embarrassed to have printed on 
the front page of your newspaper (Your love life, your weekend adventures, your 
political views. Nada. Enough said.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
So what's left?  Work.  Ho-hum.  And I think that's the general idea.
