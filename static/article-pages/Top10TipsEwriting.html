			Strive For a Style Somewhere Between Stuffed-Shirt Writing and T-Shirt Writing 
Just as the business casual dress code has some people stumped, so has the business causal 
writing style. Some writers confuse the screen for a t-shirt slogan.  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Avoid Knee-Jerk Responses </B><BR>
								E-mail's greatest benefit can also be its greatest drawback:  speed.  We open. We read. We reply. 
Then we think - or don't, as the case may be. <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>If You Don't Have Something To Say, Don't Say It </B><BR>
								On the street, when someone you know speaks to you, etiquette requires that you return the 
greeting. Not so with e-mail.   <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Check It, But Don't Be Chained To It </B>
Instead of being constantly distracted, let the e-mails pile up and check them only once or twice a 
day.  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Use The "So What?" Prompt To Turn Information into Communication </B><BR>
								Imagine your reader asking, "So what?"  Then add the answer:  Draw conclusions. State the 
action you want.  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Avoid Stream-Of-Consciousness Rambling </B><BR>
								Just as the penny is the basis for our monetary system, the sentence is our basic unit of thought. If 
your e-mail wasn't all that interesting to read the first time, imagine forcing people to slog 
through it a second time to catch your meaning. <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Tune in to the Tone of Directives </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Brief is good.  Blunt is not.  </B><BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Guard Against A Trigger-Happy "Send" Finger </B><BR>
								As a safety measure, don't enter the recipients e-mail address until you have the e-mail ready to 
go-with all attachments. Then if your trigger finger goes off, your e-mail is still safely in your 
hands.  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Make Sure "Anytime, Anywhere" Doesn't Mean "No Time, Nowhere" </B><BR>
								Many organizations advertise that they're available anytime anywhere.  But the reality is that that 
expectation disappoints all too often.  Email goes unanswered for days and weeks.  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Know When To Phone Instead of Writing E-Mail or Letters </B><BR>
								People are typically less guarded when speaking than writing. Choose according to your purpose.   
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>Be Wary of Humor or Sarcasm </B><BR>
								Comedy writers earn big bucks.  Either make sure your humor works or don't try it.   
 <BR>

								Dianna Booher Article Excerpted from E-Writing 2 
Understand Your Liability for Personal E-Mails on Company Systems.  
Inexpensive software packages can scan up to 50,000 e-mails an hour for objectionable words 
(unfair, performance review, copyright, breast, resume, angry) and forward those messages to a 
designated person. Consider that your e-mail may be retrieved for any number of things that keep 
people awake at night.
