			Which of the four behavioral styles best represents you?  We'll do this by 
focusing on two areas -- how direct or indirect you are, and how open or guarded 
you are.<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Indirect people tend to avoid taking bold risks or spontaneous actions.  
Taken to an extreme, it can be interpreted as indecisive.   Indirect people also 
tend to be less confronting and demanding.   They tend to move at a slower 
pace.  For them, "sooner or later" is good enough. <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Indirect people tend to consider the pros and cons, and attend to the 
details.  They generally operate according to established formats and rules.  You 
can count on them to show up on time.  They tend to communicate by asking 
instead of telling and they're understated and reserved.       <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Direct people tend to be faster paced, more assertive, and more 
competitive.  If carried to an extreme they can seem hasty, combative or 
insensitive to others' needs.  They're much freer with their opinions -- and they're 
extroverted.   You could safely say they're "action oriented."  They're the ones 
who'll take the initiative to introduce themselves to others.  
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								They prefer rapid decisions and can become impatient when things don't 
move fast enough or go their way.  Checking for errors is something they'll 
delegate to others if they can.   In fact, they often rush into so many new areas 
that their time seems to evaporate into thin air.      
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Direct people enjoy taking risks.  They won't back down when they believe 
what they're saying.  In fact, "intensity" could be their middle name.     
If they feel they need to bend an established rule or policy to accomplish 
something -- they probably will.   Direct people tend to feel that if they throw 
enough against the wall, something has to stick.  
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Open people don't mind straying off the subject to discuss personal 
experiences.  As long as it's in the ballpark, it will be acceptable to them.  It's 
also all right with them to exaggerate details a bit.  Their time perspective will 
more likely be organized around the needs of people first, and tasks second.   By 
contrast, someone with more Guarded behavior usually places a higher priority 
on getting things done.   To them, the task itself will be more important than who 
does it. And if you've got a dream -- or a vision -- or a new direction you want to 
take-- they're the ones who'll support you and catch that vision.  They'll be able 
to see it even if you don't have any data to back it up.      
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								If people who express more Open behavior seems like open books, then 
Guarded people tend to exhibit 'poker faces'.   They like to keep their distance--- 
both physically and mentally. They place a high value on reality and facts.      
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Guarded people like structure, since they expect results within that 
structured environment.   They can be counted on to base their decisions on 
evidence; stay focused on the issue at hand; and stick to the agenda.   As more 
naturally independent workers, they need to control the conditions around their 
tasks.   They're more disciplined about how other people use their time.  You 
might say that Guarded people focus on thoughts or ideas.    
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								When you combine the two scales, you arrive at four different behavioral 
styles.   
    <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								If you chose yourself as both Direct and Open, I call your style the 
"Socializer."    Individuals who chose Direct and Guarded behaviors are called 
Directors.  If your type is Indirect and Guarded, you are a Thinker.  Finally, if your 
description fits Indirect and Open behaviors, your style is called the Relater.    
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Directors are the ones who want to take control and do things their way.  
They're accomplishment oriented and often seem to have unlimited energy 
toward reaching their goals.  They've got high ego strength.  Inaction and 
hesitation often quickly erode their patience.   
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Socializers' persuasive powers often get others even more excited about 
their ideas than they are themselves.  They're the only style who can talk people 
into various situations...even if they don't have all the facts.  Or any!    Their key 
need is recognition.  They need pats on the back and applause.   
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Relaters are the best team players.  They like to keep things constant 
and 'as is'.  They're relationship oriented, active listeners who often use their 
counseling skills to enhance their relationships.  They hate conflict and feel 
extremely uncomfortable if anyone becomes angry with them.   
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Thinkers specialize in problem solving and precision.  If you want 
something done right, give it to them.  They'll typically finish a project virtually 
error-free--no checking required by others--because they need to be correct.
