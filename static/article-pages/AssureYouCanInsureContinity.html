Tell me that you can insure my property to guarantee continued coverage.<br>
									<br><br>
									Here's an explanation to help you keep these three troublesome words straight in your mind:<br>
									<br><br>
									Assure - To pledge or give confidence to people--use in the same way as reassure: He assured us that he would attend.<br>
									<br><br>
									Ensure - To guarantee or make certainóuse in cases other than when referring to people: This new packaging will ensure that the product arrives safely.<br>
									<br><br>
									Insure - To make certain or protect against loss--use when referring to monetary payments: This bond will insure payment up to $2000.<br>
									<br><br>
									The dictionary gives all three words as synonyms of each other. But a synonym has a SIMILAR meaning--not the same meaning. For example, &quot;big,&quot; &quot;large,&quot; &quot;huge,&quot; and &quot;gargantuan&quot; are synonyms, but you can't use them interchangeably: You might say, &quot;He gave a BIG speech about saving money.&quot; But you wouldn't say, &quot;He gave a LARGE speech about saving money.&quot;<br>
									<br><br>
									When your choices are &quot;assure,&quot; &quot;insure,&quot; and &quot;ensure,&quot; take care. Unless you work for an insurance company, you'll need &quot;ensure&quot; most of the time.<br>
