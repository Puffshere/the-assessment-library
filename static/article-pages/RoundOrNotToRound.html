			Some of the most insidious misuses of "statistics" show up in television commercials.  
Unlike ad writers, other business professionals seldom purposefully mislead. But 
carelessness with statistics can confuse readers. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								If there's one common characteristic in most technical writing, it's a document chock-full 
of jargon, symbols, abbreviations, and numbers. If the subject is already a complex one, 
the numbers and symbols add to its complexity.  
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								So you need to handle all numbers, statistics, and symbols with your purpose in mind.  
Are you using the numbers to create a specific effect--to entertain, to educate, to create 
awareness, to caution, to persuade, or simply to show that youíve done your 
homework?  
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Your purpose will dictate your plan and you precision. 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								In the testing and procedural sections of a document, of course, you will give numbers 
that are appropriately precise because readers of these sections will need to know 
specifics. But when you summarize the major conclusions in an executive overview, be 
cautious about statistical overkill. Rounded numbers are easier to grasp quickly and to 
remember ("about 50 percent" rather than "52.1 percent"). 
  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								How authoritative is your document?  If you have to tell someone how authoritative it is, 
it isn't.
