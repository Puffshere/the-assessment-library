			Imprecise words represent convoluted thinking.  Consider these classics Iíve collective 
through the years:  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								· We are going to pre-board the plane. (How can you board an airplane 
before you board it?) <BR>
								· I want to take a day out of your time to discuss this. (Not if I can help it! 
A day out of my schedule maybe.) <BR>
								· The appreciation of a host-controlled environment will become not only 
the best way but the only way to implement complexity of a distributed 
network. (Is the appreciation a way? Why would they want to 
implement complexity--job security maybe?) <BR>
								· The question may no longer be valid for all brick walls--changes in 
construction materials and methods jeopardize its truthfulness. (How 
can brick walls be truthful?  Does the writer mean integrity or stability?) <BR>
								· A clear understanding of the conversion that will take place is 
illustrated by the diagrams that follow. (The understanding is 
illustrated? They have a diagram of brain waves?) <BR>
								· The following list of security coordinators has authority to write policy 
statements. (The list is going to write the statements? Does that mean 
the coordinators themselves can go home?) <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Think about the logic of the entire sentence and make sure the words strung together 
say what you mean.
