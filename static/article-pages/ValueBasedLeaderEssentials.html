			 Can you train someone to be a leader?  Can you develop leadership 
qualities within yourself? The answer is yes. In fact, we must -- as individuals, 
organizations, and a nation. Across the country, people are reassessing 
priorities and reevaluating policies, procedures, and people resources. The 
next century will be the most challenging the world has ever faced. Without 
effective leaders at every level of our society, we will be ill equipped to meet 
those challenges.  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								One of the most exciting prospects in the next century is a new definition 
of success. We will still want to be successful, but that concept will include the 
necessity for making a contribution, a personal difference. That means that you 
and will take responsibility for leading ourselves first, then extending these skills 
to our families, jobs, and communities. This kind of grassroots leadership is what 
will make the difference in building our organizations and our country.  
<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Effective, value-based leadership has two parts. First is the desire to 
serve, to be a servant-leader. (The Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu defined a 
leader as "one who serves.") Second is understanding that we lead first by 
example.  Everything we say or do sends a message, sets a tone, or teaches 
people what to do or not to do.  <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								With this foundation firmly in place, you can focus on the twelve essential 
qualities for serving more effectively and setting powerful examples that motivate 
and inspire others-- the qualities that make you a leader who makes a difference.  
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>1. Have a mission that matters. </B><BR>
								Having a mission that matters, one that makes a difference, is at the core 
of leadership. It motivates and inspires followers. It is a powerful leadership 
quality that builds charisma. It releases leaders' full potential and is their driving 
force. A mission acts like a magnet in attracting others. Missions often start 
small; their size is not important. That the leader has a mission is what's 
important. A clear, value-based mission is a shining example to followers. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>2. Be a big thinker. </B><BR>
								Robert F. Kennedy, quoting poet Robert Frost, said, "Some men see 
things as they are and say, 'Why?' I dream of things that never were and say, 
'Why not?'" Leaders have the ability to visualize on a larger perspective. Leaders 
are courteous and have what Cavett Robert calls "Divine Discontent." They 
challenge tradition, are not afraid of idealism, and are eager to create and  
bring out the best in others. Big thinkers have a clear definition of their personal 
goals and have the ability to help others expand their thinking and imagination. 
 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>3. Be ethical. </B><BR>
								Albert Schweitzer said, "Ethics is the maintaining of life at the highest 
point of development." A leader has clearly defined ethics and is steadfast in 
upholding them, even in the worst of times. Reaching for the highest point of 
development is the example leaders set for their followers. Leaders have a 
keen sense of fairness and justice. They are high principled and law abiding. 
 2 
They value the rights of others and respect their followers. They have strong 
convictions and are not afraid to stand and be counted. They know that true 
success means having high ethics. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>4. Be a change-master.</B><BR>
								Rosabeth Moss Kanter calls leaders "prime movers." They move people in 
directions more beneficial to all. Leaders have the ability to create change, to 
accept it, handle it, and succeed during times of change. They welcome change 
as the only constant in life. They learn from the past and then let it go. They don't 
burden themselves with old ideas, prejudices, habits, or processes. Inspired 
leaders look for the opportunity in change and understand that they don't have to 
like the change, but they must understand it. They live by the tenet of the 
Serenity Prayer, "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot 
change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the 
difference. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>5. Be sensitive. </B><BR>
								Sensitivity is a new quality for today's leaders. We live in a much more 
complex and quickly changing world than past leaders did, so we must be 
sensitive to a wider range of concerns. Today's leaders must be sensitive to 
the needs, values, and perceptions of their followers because, without 
responsive, productive people, other considerations quickly become secondary. 
Sensitivity builds one of the most desirable qualities in a follower -- loyalty. Daniel 
Yankelovich describes sensitivity as one of the "soft" qualities crucial to a 
leader's effectiveness. At its best, sensitivity is called "people building." 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>6. Be a risk taker. </B><BR>
								Risk taking is a vital part of leadership. Leaders have the courage to begin 
while others are waiting for better times, safer situations, or assured results. 
Leaders are willing to take a risk because they know that too much caution and 
indecision rob them of opportunity and success. They are willing to fail in order to 
succeed. Leaders know that no one wins all the time, and that winning is not 
always the goal. They take initiative, are independent, and are not unduly 
influenced by others. Leaders live by the philosophy that "anything worth doing is 
worth doing poorly -- at first." They allow themselves and others to grow by 
making mistakes. They don't expect perfection. President Harry Truman said, 
"Life is risky." Leaders take risks. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>7. Be a decision maker. </B><BR>
								Deciding to decide is often more difficult than carrying through, once the 
decision has been made. Leaders know that not deciding is a decision. It allows 
time, fate, and circumstances to make the choices. The leader is aware of this 
and would rather make a wrong decision than none at all. Few decisions in life 
are so critical that they cannot be corrected. Leaders know that indecision wastes 
time, energy, talent, money, and opportunity. They make decisions and 
commitments to avoid future failures. Leaders are willing to make decisions and 
plans that affect future generations because they know indecision will forfeit 
everyone's future. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>8. Use power wisely. </B>
 3 
 Leaders do not shrink from power, nor do they seek it unnecessarily. They 
know that having clout often intimidates others, so they use their power 
judiciously. They "pull rank" only in emergencies. Leaders know that the "higher 
up you go, the more gently down you reach." They use their power to direct 
others and help them achieve their full potential. Leaders take responsibility for 
themselves, their actions, and the results. They use their power to instill this 
example in others. They know that power and greatness are not a goal, but 
rather byproducts of learning how to serve. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>9. Be a communicator. </B><BR>
								The power to communicate is the key to forging productive relationships. 
Good communication pays off in a leader's ability to: <BR>
								· Motivate and inspire people.<BR>
								· Take action. <BR>
								· Maintain focus on the issues. <BR>
								· Prevent communication breakdowns.<BR>
								· Resolve conflicts. <BR>
								· Provide accurate information. <BR>
								· Build cooperation and trust.<BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								The better a leader communicates, the better the chance to make a 
difference.  "What you are speaks so loudly, I cannot hear what you say," wrote 
author Ralph Waldo Emerson. When a leader's words and actions match, 
communication becomes the highest form of leading by example. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>10. Be a team builder. </B><BR>
								Team building encompasses all the qualities of a leader. It maximizes the 
potential of both leader and follower. The team building leader of the next century 
will be a coach -- directing, motivating, training, delegating, and making work 
enjoyable. Team building is the catalyst of all a leader wants to accomplish. 
Servant-leaders create teams of caring, cooperative, committed followers. A 
leader recently said, "Team building is the most difficult and at the same time the 
most rewarding of all my responsibilities." 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>11. Be courageous. </B><BR>
								"You must do the thing you cannot do," said Eleanor Roosevelt. "You gain 
strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop 
to look fear in the face."  Leaders must have a strong belief system so they 
can withstand and boldly meet today's challenges while maintaining their 
courage and convictions. Believing in their physical, emotional, intellectual, 
and spiritual standards and values enables them to apply their resources and 
creative energy when faced with problems of overwhelming odds. General 
George C. Patton said that courage is "fear holding on another minute." Leaders 
are valiant and undaunted in their approach to life. They "hold on." They venture 
forth with faith and stamina and set a courageous example for others to 
follow. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								<B>12. Be committed.</B><BR>
								Commitment is a primary word for leaders. They realize that, without it, all 
else is meaningless. Commitment runs deep in leaders. Dedication to their 
missions pull others to them. Their commitment exudes confidence and hope. 
Others become committed when they are with an unselfish, committed leader. 
They commit to high standards of excellence for themselves and others. They 
know that people grown when striving for excellence. They determine a course, 
make a plan and have the self discipline to follow through, despite obstacles. <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Leaders stay long after others give up. They know that life and business 
are like the seasons; thus their commitment is sustained through good and bad, 
hot and cold, and ups and downs. They know that spring (hope and opportunity) 
follows winter (darkness and lack of growth). Leaders are committed to their 
goals while living one day at a time, knowing that if they take care of today, 
tomorrow will take care of itself. Above all, leaders that make a difference 
are committed.
