								<strong>3 Pre-employment Tests That Help You Hire The Best</strong></font>

						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"> <strong><em>Question:</em></strong>  What's the easiest, cheapest and quickest way to have profitable, productive, and honest employees?<br>
								<br>
								 <strong>Answer: </strong> Hire profitable, productive, honest people!<br>
								<br>
								Unfortunately, managers often hire underachievers or losers.  Fortunately, pre-employment tests give managers a simple-to-use, quick, customizable way to hire the best.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>Only 1 Reason to Screen Applicants<br>
								</strong> The sole reason to assess applicants is to predict "ì or forecast "ì how an applicant will behave on-the-job BEFORE you hire the person.  It proves crucial to prediction this before hiring an applicant, rather than finding out the expensive way after you put the person on your payroll.<br>
								<br>
								The main methods used to predict if an applicant will succeed on-the-job are<br>
							</font></p>
						<ul>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Interviews<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Reference Checks<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Pre-employment Tests</font>
						</ul>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>Alarming Research<br>
								</strong> Large-scale research discovered most interviewers and reference checks make lousy predictions of actual on-the-job performance.  Interviews and reference checks often are about as useful as flipping a coin!<br>
								<br>
								 On the bright side, pre-employment tests prove to be the best forecasters of actual on-the-job performance.  Reason:  Tests are developed with scientific research techniques so they objectively predict how an applicant will act on-the-job.  In contrast, interviews and reference checks typically offer only subjective "guesstimates"ù of an applicant's work potential.<br>
								 <br>
								<strong>3 Types of Tests<br>
								</strong> Traits required for job success boil down to A + B + C:<br>
								 A = Abilities "ì mental abilities "ì brainpower "ì to do the job<br>
								 B = Behavior "ì interpersonal skills, personality and motivations needed to succeed<br>
								 C = Character "ì honesty, work ethic, impulsiveness, theft/stealing, &amp; substance abuse<br>
								<br>
								As such, A + B + C = Success on-the-job.  Importantly, you can use tests to predict an applicant's Abilities, Behavior, and Character.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>A = Abilities Tests<br>
								</strong>Did you ever hire someone and, later, horrifyingly discover the person had the IQ of tire pressure?  That person did not have brainpower to (a) learn the job or (b) solve problems on-the-job.  Abilities tests help you avoid hiring people who lack brainpower to learn and do the job.  Five abilities tests tell you how well the applicant handles</font></p>
						<ol>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Problem-Solving<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Vocabulary<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Arithmetic<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Grammar, Spelling, &amp; Word Use<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Small Details</font>
						</ol>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><br>
								<strong>B = Behavior Tests<br>
								</strong>Each job requires crucial behaviors.  For example, my research shows superstar sales reps often are money motivated, optimistic, and assertive.  Many jobs require teamwork, friendliness, and customer service.  To help you, behavior tests forecast applicants'</font></p>
						<ol>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Interpersonal Skills<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Personality<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Motivations</font>
						</ol>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">For instance, a behavior test predicts three interpersonal skills:  (a) friendliness, (b) assertiveness, and (c) teamwork.  Five personality traits assessed include (a) energy level (b) optimism, (c) objectivity, (d) procedure-following, and (e) desire to focus on feelings or facts.  Motivations uncover if an applicant strives to do a good job to (a) make lots of money, (b) provide customer service, (c) do creative work, (d) exert power or control, or (e) increase knowledge. </font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>C = Character Tests<br>
								</strong>Did you ever hire someone who had a lousy work ethic?  Stole from your company?  Abused alcohol or drugs?  That cost you loads of money and time!  Character tests help managers avoid hiring problem employees.  Such tests predict an applicant's attitudes on work-related dependability:</font></p>
						<ol>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Work Ethic<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Impulsiveness<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Theft/Stealing Concerns<br>
								</font>
							<li><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Substance Abuse Concerns<br>
								</font>
						</ol>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">When you hire a "good apple"ù -- and avoid hiring a "bad apple"ù "ì you make a big difference in productivity and profits.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>Customize Tests You Use<br>
								</strong>It is highly recommended you customize abilities and behavior tests for each job in your company.  Do this by conducting a benchmarking study.<br>
								<br>
								<em>Example: </em> Let's say you want to hire profitable, productive sales reps.  Start by testing some of your current sales reps.  Statistically pinpoint your superstar sales reps' typical test scores.  Then, when you test applicants, you quickly will see if the applicant scores similar to "ì or different than "ì your superstar sales reps.<br>
								<br>
								You, of course, would prefer to hire applicants (1) whose test scores are similar to your superstars' test scores "ì plus also (2) impress you in interviews and other assessments.  However, you would avoid hiring an applicant whose test scores are much different than your superstars' test scores.</font></p>
						<p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>6 Steps to Help You Hire the Best<br>
