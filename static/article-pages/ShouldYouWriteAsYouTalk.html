			You may have heard this adage to writers with a stuffy style, who fill their documents with 
"please be advised," "pursuant to our meeting," and "enclosed herewith."   <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Generally, "to write as you talk" is good advice.  But misunderstood, that advice leads to 
rambling prose.  Instead of a period, writers often succumb to a confusing habit of linking 
scrambled thoughts with "which": <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								"I emailed my broker about the problem with the duplicate entries on my 
IRA account, which he said was fairly common when you make two 
years' contribution with the same check, which I did this January, 
including a contribution for the previous year along with the contribution 
for the current year, which is, of course, expedient for my purposes but not 
for the broker.  They've made several errors recently, which is why I had 
to re-send the last paycheck deposit twice, which is becoming a problem 
for our own payroll department, which is responsible for stopping 
payment on checks and reissuing them when there's a problem, which is 
what I had to ask them to do this past payroll period."
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								Speakers often punctuate with "which" and a breath.  Writers should not. 
 <BR>
								&nbsp;<BR>
								By all means, on most occasions, write as you would talk. That is, use a conversational tone, 
informal word choice, and flowing sentence patterns--but without grammatical errors, repetition, 
and disjointed ideas.  
<BR>
