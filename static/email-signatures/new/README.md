# Generating Email Signatures

Copy an existing email signature and edit the HTML to match the new hire. To generate the image version, use the element inspector in Chrome and select the
wrapping tbody. Press `⌘ + Shift + P` or `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type `screenshot` in the command menu. Select the "Capture Node Screenshot" option. Once you
have the image downloaded, resize the image in half (only resize if you are using a retina display) and save it as a png.
